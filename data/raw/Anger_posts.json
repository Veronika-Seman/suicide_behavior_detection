I am not as bad. I don’t always flip at the switch of a hat, but sometimes I do. I don’t mean to, and I feel horrible afterwards, especially because I can’t ever remember the episode of rage. My father.. doesn’ t. When he does apologise it sounds rehearsed and fake, and I’m pretty sure my mum prompts the apology almost every time. When she doesn’t, he either doesn’t apologise, comes over and starts to sound like he’s going apologise by starting with “I’m sorry” then apologises for my stupidity, or other some other insulting thing, or, he apologises because he knows that I will just simply accept it because he beat me down enough that time that I won’t even think of not accepting because I just want him to stop yelling at me.\n\nThis happened 2 and a half hours ago:\nMy father and I were talking about a chest CT I got a while ago, neither of us could remember what it was called and while I trying to think and remember he kept throwing out ideas. He often does this, speaks when someone is clearly trying to think, I raised my voice a little, not much, so little that I wouldn’t even consider it yelling, just talking a little loudly, I said that I was trying to think and he just keeps talking while I’m trying to think. Immediately, he starts yelling.\n\nI am still crying, almost sobbing because of what he said, and the fact that depending on what is said, I believe that what you say when you’re angry, you have to at least half mean it. An example straight from today: a parent saying while angry that they hope their child will suffer and die: They mean it, they have to mean that, because if they don’t not only is that a problem in itself, it doesn’t matter in the slightest because it’s something you can’t take back.\n\n\nI want to know how to stop myself from raising my voice higher than normal volume when getting frustrated or how to force myself to keep my mouth shut. Before the frustration is expressed at all, because even slight expression of my anger sets him off.\n\nI know what I’m looking for is unhealthy, but mentally hurting myself enough to push myself into constant apathy would be less damaging than my father’s words at this point.\nSo please someone tell me how, because I this might be my only possibility.

I started telling the other teachers about my strategies and one wouldn't look at me and had a mocking smile. This teacher has laughed when I've spoken at meetings, so I asked some other teachers about it, and learned that there's a clique of teachers who've been harassing other teachers by laughing, gossiping, and false-reporting. Since she wouldn't look at me I told her to look at me when I'm talking, then I told the principal that there's an issue I needed to address. I said that a couple teachers had laughed at me when I was mentioned at a meeting, and that I'd learned that there's a clique of teachers who've been targeting other teachers including myself. The HM asked if that clique included either of the teachers present and I said yes, the teacher looked at me like I was being crazy, and I said \"you know exactly what I'm talking about.\" She just laughed and said \"no I don't\" and I said \"I know, it's so fucking funny.\" Obviously, cussing at co-workers is unacceptable, especially at a school. Plus I did it in front of the principal. I apologized.\n\nNow I feel absolutely miserable. I wish I hadn't cussed, and I feel so stupid for doing so. My real concern is that I don't want this to affect my relationships with the other teachers, because my relationships with them are important to me.\n\nI've been low key and relaxed lately, and things were honestly going well for me, which may have contributed to my lashing out - I wasn't expecting it.

I used to have pretty good coping mechanisms in that taking myself off for a hike, listening to music, shouting/beating into a pillow or doing something creative would almost always put me back on balance.\n\nThe issue atm is that there is been a cascade of injustice in a short period of time that has more or less destroyed my quality of life and work schedule. I am not experiencing any relief from any of my usual coping mechanisms and I feel as if my anger is going to eat me alive. For example, I've only been sleeping for about 3 hours at a time because I'm thinking about things I don't want to. I go to bed angry and get up angry, and there is no end in sight.

I also have moments where I feel like cutting people off from my life, even though I don’t lash out at them.

They believe I’m always calm and nice, and that I don’t have the capability to get angry. However, when something triggers me, like memories of my parents or feelings of frustration with myself, it brings up a lot of emotion.\n\nRight now, I’m seeing a counselor, and therapy has been really helpful in helping me understand these behaviors and why I am the way I am.

    "selftext": "When I (30f) was 22, a guy I lived with, slightly younger than me (I think 18, might have been 19) picked a real big fight with me during one of the lowest points in my life. I wish I could tell you who started it or what it was about but seven years (that has gone so fast) is seven years too long ago. I have vivid trauma flashbacks to when he eventually threw himself on the ground and told me to kick him (i don't even remember why at this point, but he was always a bit of a ginormous drama queen) and I did. Once. Just once. Never again. Never laid hands on ANYONE after that no matter how angry I feel.\n\nI remember being angry. I remember feeling justified. I remember immediately afterwards going oh my god, no, I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. But I can't remember anything else. \n\nAfter this happened I was so traumatized by my own actions in anger I started developing malaptive disassociation. I look in mirrors and all I see is abuser. This person started warning people - my friends - about me, and I was honest with them about the situation and they told me that it wasn't my fault. Even the person I kicked admitted they shouldn't have antagonized me like that and not expected me to react in a moment of heated anger and adrenaline but...\n\n7 years later. Despite forgiveness I did not ask for (in fact, it was them who came to me, and asked me if I would accept theirs, and I did. I do.) I still lay awake on nights like tonight reliving that memory. I'd had similar outbursts with fights with my siblings, and of course my siblings all laugh and say, well you forgave me, right? And I say, well yeah, I beat the snot of you too. My parents say we are bound to lose our shit eventually too. Even three therapists have all assured me, I've done the right thing. I've moved to improve myself. I have gotten and given forgivance. \n\nAnd yet I am still prone to anger. I still relive this one memory of hurting someone. Sometimes it is replaced my hurting my mom during my teen fits. Sometimes, my brothers during my childhood. Any time domestic abuse comes up on a screen, I am reminded of my own disgusting, selfish behavior, and it triggers this deep need to end my own existence, or run away, or tell the world I'm an abuser. I never have, and I have an amazing number of things to live for (especially my elderly parents and disabled brother who rely on me, I promise, I am safe.) \n\nBut I want this anger to stop. I fear it. I fear losing control. I fear destroying lives. I try to live good. I volunteer. I take care of my friends and my family. I have many positive things going for me. But there are days this intrusive memory pops up and I wonder, who will be the next victim of my anger? My mother, again? My partner? God forbid, my future children? \n\nI don't know what I seek from posting this. Solidarity? Answers? Guidance? Maybe just simply...relief in letting it go out there into the world and admitting that anger has traumatized me for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't want to be chained to this feeling I can't control anymore. I want to be free.",

I am 34 now, but during the time my dad's dad ( my grandpa ) passed away, he started to take care of two of his siblings that have always had a very terrible history of drug abuse and alcohol abuse. If it wasn't for my dad and mom, they'd be homeless and for years we had a very healthy-ish relationship with them. My uncle and I were the best of friends, but my aunt would often reallyyyy stress both me and my parents out and I never really liked her. \n\nA few years later in 2018 my mom had fallen ill with kidney failure and died extremely fast, leaving me with my dad and his siblings and in the beginning of 2020 my dad had died of lung cancer. ( As much as his death affected me, I was more aware that he was dying because he had struggled with cancer in the past. ) Because of this, and my dad loving me so much... they put the house in my name and I had even earned his monthly paycheck by being his only daughter. \n\nI swear it was right after my dad died that the emotional abuse would happen. Its like an evil switch affected my relatives, I had been called names I was never called in my life over extremely stupid and mundane stuff. This constant stress would almost ruin my life until my best friend moved in with me and my life got DRASTICALLY better.... until my aunt started to be very terrible to my friend, and at that point I had no more respect for her.\n\nI could go on forever about how shitty they treat me, how no respect they have for me... I pay every bill, I do everything on my own.... I have no idea why I keep them here but the more emotional stress the more I start to question if my anger is even healthy. I lived my whole life in a healthy, happy relationship with my parents.... God, I miss them both so bad. I miss the constant love and companionship they gave me. I don't even know what to do anymore. My anger, depression, my hate at times drives me completely insane.

When I came out of the elevator, unfortunately for her she was waiting for it, so when the door opened I told her she needed to learn to have respect in a building like this because that shit might not go well for her with someone else. That she needed to apologize in a situation like that.  I asked her why she did it and she came up with excuses that she is a caregiver and only has 5 hours until work and the other machines were broken, which just set me off. I was definitely raising my voice at this point as told she had life fucked up if she was going to operate like that.

She ran away.\n\nI felt pretty good about it, but also ashamed of my anger.

Which it did; somewhat...but in that moment I just had to let my ego win? \n\nI told her that I didn't give a fuck about her kid, (I didn't mean that, I was just pissed off) and that you need to be more careful and make a conscious effort to not do that anymore.\n\nTruth is, I wasn't mad at this woman at all, I was truly pissed off at the driver, because we made eye contact and he knew that his wife fucked up and tried to brush it off like it was nothing and drive off. \n\nMy car is no prized possession. It's a piece of shit, but it's mine and I try to take care of it. But It's the disrespect that I cannot take! It's the little things that will piss you off.\n\n\nI know I fucked up and lost my cool. But who am I to just accept my personal property being violated right in front of me? Laying in bed feeling awful about it,  but then there's something deep down that feels satisfied in a way, almost like I'm an addict and I got my fix. \n\nPlease don't judge me ",

When it comes time for my turn, I introduce myself like everyone else and my “random fact” was simply “I’m a senior at xyz university”. The professor immediately points out that that’s “boring” and the whole class erupts with laughter which is embarrassing but it’s whatever I don’t get embarrassed easily. What came next did bother me however, once the laughter resided another kid three seats away from me says “That’s boring”. In the past I would have snapped instantly, his random fact was that he has five sisters. Ok dude and no one gives a fuck about your five sisters either. I played it off cool like it was whatever, but it’s still a problem in my head as i’m drinking my tea right now trying to figure out why it bothers me so much. These little quips always bother me the most, just last semester in a group project I was working in I was chatting basketball with one of the group members, when another one of the members interjected into our conversation and said I was stupid for thinking what I thought. In that case I wasn’t good though, I let me emotions get the best of me and I immediately snapped at him in front of the whole class - makes me feel bad but my pride in the moment made me feel justified to do that. I take insults very personal, my pride is on a pedestal. I’m glad I didn’t make the same mistake today on the first day of class. It’s very frustrating though to be 21 years old and still have these feelings when somebody takes a dig at me, i’m trying to work on letting things go and not resorting to anger instantly but then all of that anger just festers in my head. The issue from there is I don’t know who to talk about this issue to, I don’t talk to my Mother/Father/Brother/Sister about my problems because I don’t want them worrying or to suddenly think completely different of me. It’s like this even with my best friend I share everything with, I feel like this feeling I get when i’m disrespected is atypical - there’s no way this is a normal response. I should be able to let something as small as this go as quickly as it comes but more than often, i’ll think about it for a while afterwards.\n\nMore than anything this is just a venting post but I am genuinely curious if anyone else feels the same, has the felt the same, or even can understand what I mean.

He always told me his boundary was being cussed at because it’s disrespecting to him. My problem is when I’m angry on text ( not really in person ) . I tend to type all caps and say so many F words to him. I was feeling lonely and sad the day before the argument and he kind of dismissed me. He also said I don’t give him space to see his family which is understandable as we spend everyday together. And it’s only the one day he goes to his family I tend to create an argument. On Sunday I was cussing at him and he even texted me if I cuss at him, he shuts down  and can’t help. I saw that as a threat and him not caring for me. It escalated to the point where he went to my place and took his things because I was threatening to throw his gifts away. I ubered to his place at midnight and demanded him to come out. But I was even swearing at him then. He never came out. Never reached out after that. And turns out, he told his best friend he broke up with me. But I was never told that- he never told me. And this whole week I thought he would have reached out. But now that I found out he told his friends we are over. I am spiraling. Because I did this. And my last relationship I did this as well. And I know I have these problems and I have been working on them. My partner knew that as well but it got to the point where he was fed up I sent him long long texts saying I’m sincerely sorry, and i understand, and this is a boundary I crossed . I made a huge mistake. I’m in so much physical pain because of this. Because he was my other half and we were going to get married. Etc. nothing. He even followed girls as well quickly on IG…. He was the one that did everything for me and would sacrifice for me but I pushed him away… The past 2 weeks I’ve been doing a lot of self reflection and I’m still dealing with the physical pain…\n\nI’m thinking of going to his parents house. And reading them a letter of how I’m sorry I never respected your space and your sons space. ( there was tension with the parents because he always saw me). His parents are Persian so I would go my way in there cultural way on doing this. And asking for a restart and remorse because i genuinely know and believe he cares for me. But I hurt him so so bad… because I know his parents also see me as I took there son away from them due to him spending and investing so much into me…\n\nHow can I also show to him or prove that I am remorseful and will and have been changing my angry reactions?",

She told me to get away from Chinese people and don't bring other people to the house etc... (as a lovely mother she is) because they could kidnap you and do unspeakable things (These things DO happen in south Asia where Chinese people scam other Chinese people into poor countries and kidnap them.)  \n\nOFC I agreed because these are obvious rules in the house, and I always obey them (I always behave and never invite friends without parent's permission) and I'm also quite excited for this experience because as a 17-year-old I'm aware I have to live by myself soon, when I go to university. She also shouldn't worry about me taking illegal substances, since I never smoke, drink or do any kind of drugs.\n\n\n\n**Last Friday** she sent me a copy and pasted article\n\n \"不要低估人性的恶，我昨天转发了一条东南亚失踪的中国女性，我不希望那是真的，但是宁可信其有，发出来提醒大家。因为有的人性恶到你难以想象，比如以前人流密集处的残疾儿童乞讨，大家应该还有印象，2014年3月13日，凤凰卫视《社会能见度》，报道“东莞儿童丐帮”的，曝光了犯罪团伙拐卖儿童并打残，逼迫他们上街乞讨。有成员回忆： “用砖头把小孩的腿打断，小孩哭得撕心裂肺的。打断之后腿部流脓，就感染，感染以后也不给治，慢慢这个腿就烂掉了，烂得流脓，他越惨他越赚钱。”\n\n节目中还说，为了不让孩子说话，犯罪分子会把他们舌头割掉或者毒哑，大一点的孩子会让他们吃安眠药缩短寿命，等到不行了以后方便随时丢弃。\n\n人命在这些人眼里一文不值，连儿童都被这帮畜生这样虐待，何况大人。割腰子摘取器官可不是新闻了。所以女性被拐至东南亚被迫害致死，可能性还是有的。很多人不信，反而对我质疑，不信可以查一下多少女性去东南亚失踪的就知道了。多少父母在发布寻女启事就知道了。反正趁我还有些流量，该做的我已经做了。转发的文章可能有些夸张，但小心一点总没错。出国记住不要搭理陌生人。特别是来路不明的“同胞”，极有可能是人贩子、诈骗犯。\"\n\nwhich is an article about people missing in Asia or people that were kidnaped and made homeless Beggers. with the intention of making me be careful of strangers. Because we been through this so many times already, I told her that \n\n\"那不应该你别把我一个人留在这里吗？\"\n\nwhich translates to \"then you shouldn't leave me here alone? \" \n\ntbh I was already getting mildly annoyed by this because we've already gone through this whole thing and how to prepare for my life alone. So, I wanted to send that to make sure she leaves me alone and let me be the one to handle it.  \n\n\n**Last Saturday,** things took a weird turn, she went on a rampage saying I should break off my relations with my Chinese friends since they could also kidnap me. I immediately went defensive against my mom about this topic. She gave whole speeches saying that the people closest to you can stab you in the back and how they will betray you and sell you out for money.  (She also said that all I do with my Chinese friends is play videogames and they don't teach me anything important)\n\n I opposed this idea and said she was a 傻逼 which can be translated to stupid b\\*\\*\\*h (**WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE IK**, but I was so incredibly mad for some reason and dropped that.)\n\nlater that evening I couldn't fall asleep and messaged her at around 2 which I'm sure is what pissed her off more, because instead of apologizing I told her she should do her own research, before she taught me what to do, which I did some research and gave her some stats with the kidnapping rate in the country.\n\nI also pointed out the things she said that day was racism, assuming Chinese people would back stab you and kidnap their friends. \n\nIn the end of the text, I said that I cannot justify the fact that I cursed at you, but your disrespecting words cannot make me respect you. (which ofc I lied, I think I still love my mom very very much)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Today** things got more tense, I went to her bedroom door and woke her up at 7:30 asking if she can send me to school (there are no school bus), She refused. Later today she left the house. \n\nShe texted me and said she would never live anywhere close to a person who cursed at her, she also stated that the moment I cursed at her she has already disowned me.  \n\nI tried to make a point using the fact that she cursed at me repeatedly when I grew up when I misbehave, how come she can let it slide just because she is my parent. \n\nShe said if I want, I can curse it back to make it even.\n\n  \n**WHAT DO I DO**\n\n\n\n",

His ego is so high that he claims to be the smartest person in the world, and everyone else are just subservient beings that are unintelligent. This, of course, makes me extremely mad.\n\nI worked really hard in high school and I was recently admitted to an Ivy league.

I know this is selfish to think about, but every parent I've met have always told me that they wish their children would look up to me, because of how hard I work.\n\nMy dad is a raging alcoholic and drinks multiple times a day.

He gets angry at every effing thing and often throws these child-like and insane tantrums where he screeches at the top of his lungs at every \"mistake\" he finds fit. Writing this now just drives me effing insane. I cannot put into words how much I hate this thing (I refuse to call him a person at this point). Because of his alcoholism and his anger-management issues, he also has high blood pressure. He claims that this is all because of my fault, since I'm the root cause for all of his stress.\n\nMy dad is a pervert. I often catch him staring at other women, and he's cheated on my mom multiple times. I came across his phone, and I saw extremely scandalous texts with multiple women. From his texts, I've found out that he is going to some sort of sexual massage shop, and has been texting a specific woman nonstop. I wrote down her phone number. From what I saw on his messages, on my birthday, the woman texted him to come over (despite the fact my dad told her it was my birthday). My dad ended up not celebrating my birthday with me to sleep with her. The texts are absolutely disgusting.\n\nMy dad gives me low self-esteem. He often calls me fat and says that I have ugly proportions. (I am a 5'7 girl and 110 lbs I do not think I am overweight). Thankfully, I don't have an eating disorder (I know how mentally difficult that can be), but I feel extremely uncomfortable and unconfident in my body.\n\nMy dad is a MISOGYNIST and a RACIST. He often tells me that women are dumber than men, and that I will never be as good as him. He makes fun for marginalized communities and calls disabled people \"losers\". (fun fact: I have a disability). He often makes fun of my disability, and I feel even more rotten when he does so. \n\nBecause of my dad, I have trouble socializing. This a\\*\\*hole leaves me so mentally drained that I go to school and cannot genuinely enjoy myself. I wish this man would leave my life forever. Unfortunately, I can't do that this easily. College tuition is incredibly expensive and I don't qualify for a lot of aid, so I need my dad to pay for my tuition. I just hope I won't ever have to see him again after college. Please give me advice on what I can do to console myself mentally. I'm 17 years old and I feel extremely tired.",

    "selftext": "I don’t know what causes my anger. Some call it being “triggered” others call it frustration, some have said I might have PTSD. Either way, I will start a conversation with my husband, and somehow when we get to a disagreement, I get defensive to the point I feel I have to defend myself because he doesn’t believe me when I’m telling the truth. Or, he doesn’t like the way I reacted to something he said, and is trying to get me to change the way I think and feel, and I get upset that I’m not allowed to have my current emotion of upset and he’s rushing me on to being in a better mood.\n\nExample:\n\nWe are self employed, and choose our own schedule. Our job requires travel, and we got a snow day. It was no one’s fault that the weather prevented us from traveling, and many clients canceled on us themselves to stay safe as well. I was excited to get a day off without it being my fault. I wanted to enjoy the snow and enjoy my free time. But my husband immediately responded to my happy attitude with “this is costing us money.” As if he was reprimanding me for my attitude, and somehow I was supposed to be what, somber and upset? So that threw off my mood because it was the first thing we talked about when we woke up. Then, he saw I wasn’t excited or happy anymore and started telling me not to let it ruin my day and it’s costing us too much money for me to ruin it with a bad mood. How the fuck am I supposed to be happy after I get reprimanded for my initial response? \nSo then I became angry, defensive, and the rest of our argument developed to other random subjects and it’s honestly a blur. But at one point he said “I’m sick of this” and I took it as ‘sick of our marriage’ so I set my ring on the table and said take it back. Of course I don’t want to get a divorce but I wanted to show him how hurtful his language is. Then he tells me not to be disrespectful, and that “triggered” me again, because it gave me a flash back of my father treating me the exact same way, and you best believe I damn well didn’t want to marry my father. \nWe have discussed as a couple when I start to show signs of anger that he needs to notice the signs and walk away, but every time he would start to say “we need to stop talking, but….” And he would constantly try to get the last word in. I eventually just had to say look, this is what I mean by ending a conversation! And I walked away to a bedroom and slammed the door, then screamed a few good times to let out my frustration.\nHe couldn’t let me be, followed me to the door, and kept trying to talk at me. “Whenever you’re ready….” I heard him trying to speak between my screams.\nThen he said he would give me half an hour to calm down, otherwise he was leaving to go hang out with his family and leaving me at home, which sounded like a threat because that would be an obvious sign to his family that something is wrong if we don’t show up together. \n\nI honestly feel like my anger is caused and egged on by my husband, and either he is so ignorant that he doesn’t know what he’s doing, or he’s doing it on purpose for some evil reason. But when I point fingers he says “my triggers are my responsibility and that should be empowering” and I need to work on myself and not blame others. \n\nI feel so gas lit I think I’m going crazy, and no one hears these fights. I tried to record one once, but he got out his phone to record as well, and I got scared he would doctor his recording to make himself sound good and me sound like the villain, because when I get mad I get sassy and rude, and he sounds “calm” even though his words make me so angry. I took both our phones and deleted the arguments so neither of us have proof. \n\nI will admit I’m not perfect, I know that others aren’t supposed to walk on egg shells around me and force themselves to change while I stay the same, I don’t want to get angry to the point of fight or flight with every disagreement, but I wish someone could see how I am treated and admit it’s like someone is poking the bear. Seriously I’m not a monk, I’m definitely going to react to things others say to me. Everyone does. But I don’t want to throw my wedding ring after every argument. If I could at least find out what causes my anger I could start researching how to get better. Is it psychological, is it a physical imbalance of hormones, is it my husband manipulating me? \n\nHelp appreciated.",

    "selftext": " For context I’m 19, and last year, when I was 18, I went through some difficult circumstances that led me to start smoking weed. I wouldn’t say I was a heavy stoner, but I smoked once or twice a day, mainly at night. Thankfully, it hasn’t even been a full year since I started, but I’ve been struggling a lot with controlling my emotions since I stopped.\n\nAs a kid I've been known for having a lot of anger issues, like severe anger issues that definitely needed councilong. When I say angry, I mean to the point where my eyes would get bloodshot red, like I was about to explode. My parents considered getting me counseling multiple times, but it never happened due to me being in the Middle East, people there really have full disregard for therapy or counseling . When we moved to the U.S., I hoped things would improve emotionally, but they didn’t. Anger has been the only emotion I feel, like it’s all I’m capable of.\n\nI started smoking weed at 18, even though I never smoked cigarettes or owned a vape. I’m also a D2 college soccer athlete, so smoking at all was pretty unexpected for someone like me. But when I first started, everything just…calmed down. I was still getting mad, but it was never as extreme as the outbursts I had when I wasn’t smoking.\n\nWhen I stopped smoking, I became very aware of how angry I was. Within a week, I got so mad till started repeatedly punching my room walls until my hands started bleeding, and the scary thing? I didn't even wanna do it,It just did. The rage felt uncontrollable. I tried quitting again a few months ago, but the anger just built up so much I felt trapped, like I was stuck in my life with no progress. Eventually, I started smoking again, and my anger dropped by around 70%.\n\nNow that I’ve quit again, I’m really losing control—not because I miss smoking, but because I just don’t want to feel this constant anger anymore. I’m completely lost. I don’t know what to do or how to handle it. When someone does something that hurts me or I disagree with, my whole body fills with this uncontrollable anger that’s hard to suppress. I borrowed my friend’s weed pen yesterday, but I haven’t touched it. I’m just sitting there, staring at it, not knowing what to do. I’m lost.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I am a 24F mom of 2 and I am having a very hard time with my anger. I almost feel like I have tried all. A little back story about me, I’d like to say I had a pretty decent childhood. I never experienced any sort of physical or emotional violence. My parents were both actively around. I didn’t have many friends, had some romantic relationships here and there. It was overall normal. I was diagnosed at 15 with Bipolar Disorder II after being hospitalized for a failed suicide attempt. Diagnosis’ kinda followed me throughout my teenage years. I was 19 when I had my daughter, thought I knew what parenting was. Was very, VERY wrong and in for a big surprise. I have always had anger issues as long as I could remember over irrational things, but they did not come out or I guess get worse until I had children. As a child, I would stub my toe and go as far as to rip everything in my room apart, throw things around, dent the wall, things of that nature. But as a parent I grew accustomed to smacking my daughter’s mouth & hand. I know some may say that some children need that sort of discipline. The thing is my daughter is GREAT, truly. A wonderful child. When I react, it is typically just that - a reaction. It is not because she is doing something wrong, it is because I get so overwhelmed and overstimulated that I end up smacking her mouth or hand. Afterwards I feel so awful and instantly regret it. I am also this way with pets. I have owned dogs before and smacked them or kicked their butt when I get frustrated. I never seen that growing up, I actually seen the complete opposite. I get so irritated if my pets aren’t listening or pee on the floor. Something so small and minuscule just sends me into a crisis. The primary areas of my life anger affects is my relationship with my kids, my relationships with my own animals, and driving. I would say I do have road rage. Not so severe that I am pulling over and getting out of the car, but I definitely will tailgate someone if they pulled in front of me or lock up my brakes to someone behind me, etc. At work though, if you were to talk to me, you’d never know these issues exist. It’s like I can put on a mask to those people and pretend to be normal, but my kids and dog get the blunt of the blow. I don’t get why or how to change it. It’s important to know that I am in therapy, I know I have an issue. I am currently on 300mg Lithium for Bipolar, 500mg Depakote for the Anger, and then I just started Quelbree 100mg for ADHD. My kids flinch when I raise my hand. I know that’s not normal and it hurts me so bad. I love my kids I really do. I know I don’t beat them but it is not normal for your child to flinch at you. I don’t need my kids to be scared of me. I want them to trust me and confide in me. I don’t know what to do. I’ve read to stop before reacting but it is just rage in the moment. Like the other day, my daughter cried and it was so high pitched and ear piercing it just sent me into a rage and felt like smacking her mouth but I didn’t. There is no rationalizing in that moment. I am taking medication, I guess I just don’t get what is wrong with me. They’ve diagnosed me with Bipolar, Borderline, and ADHD. My doctor says that I have PTSD from childhood, but I can’t recall any traumatic events that would’ve resulted in me being the way I am. I know this is a lot but I am trying to be the best mom I can. I am trying to do right by my kids. We dont get hit as adults when we do something incorrectly so I want the same thing for my children. Any advice, any help, any recommendations, any ideas or personal experience or relatable suggestions would be appreciated and I will read each and every one of them. Thank you again. ",

My mother, whom I still live with despite my age, has issues with anxiety, alcohol + is ill with cancer and constantly talks about commiting suicide (rest of my family says it is emotional manipulation but idk I feel like she is serious), yesterday evening she came back from my grandparents house because they had fight about her alcohol issues and they pointed out she is drunk. After coming inside, she expected me to comfort her instantly but since I am also tired of ther addiction I couldn't bring myself to do it. I felt overwhelmed and went outside just in my pajamas and coat. Went to grandparents house and talked about the situation, then went for a walk to decompress. After coming back inside around 10 pm she started accusing me of aligning against her, having no love for her and no empathy.\nThis moment I lost all the control and started screaming like I was skinned alive, walking around the flat, for maybe 20-30 seconds and beating my own face and legs, screamed something about killing myself and that my family should never procreate so I wouldn't have to deal with all of this. I have never had such an outburst before, I would selfharm, sometimes I would scream for a second but NOT LIKE THAT. It was fullblown meltdown. I live in post-soviet apartment block, the walls are thin as fuck. Few moment after that we heard knocking on our doors, it was our neighbours asking if we need help because they thought somebody broke in and attacked us! My mother answered and said \"my daughter has a panic attack\". I never has been so ashamed in my live of my own action. To be clear - I am adult woman, not a child and I am not diagnosed with any condition that can cause such meltdowns. My behavious can't be excused and I should control myself better. Now I am scared to even leave my flat because I am afraid of meeting my neighbours who propably ALL heard me that night, and think I am insane or abuse my mother. I ditched  from going to lectures today, and I am afraid of even going to grocery store. I feel so embarrased of myself, and I am afraid I made my mother feel guilty when she is the most ill of all of us and she is the one that needs most help and support - not me.\nHow I move foward from something like this?

I'm not going to crap all over myself for having anger issues, I do it because I don't like the way I see people treat each other all around. At this point I don't even want anger management or help, I am glad for my anger issues cuz I am a passive person and I see my anger issues as a form of self-defense not a defect. If your anger is interrupting your life, definitely get help. But if it's a form of self-defense embrace it. The world needs more people standing up to jerk offs.",

I even tried to dance with her, as I've had music on whilst cleaning.\nShe pulled back and started to moan at me about waking her up.\n\nThis instantly threw me into a rage.\n\nI have never been physical to people with my rage but have, and still do, punch solid objects and punch holes in walls.

Going behind someone going 15 under the speed limit, or someone that keeps speeeeding up, and slooooowing down (every. Day. After. Work) I drop something, pick it up, only to drop it again. Lose something (all the time), I blow a fuse, over anything that inconveniences me. Now, I have to add in, I do not react physically. I have verbal ‘tantrums’, and just spout off whatever it is I’m feeling at that very moment, until I cool off. I also have to add in, my wife is not on the receiving end of any of this. She has talked to me, concerned (lovingly) and tells me that it’s not worth it, and it’ll affect my health down the line. I know she’s right, and I hate that I’m this way, but the thing is, it feels like when one bad thing, or inconvenience happens to me? It’s 4-5 more in a row. I have no time to simmer, or recover from the last thing, it’s just a straight domino affect. I’ve searched, and searched, and searched myself, to figure out why I’m like this. I’ve wondered if it has any ties to my tinnitus, my back, and knee pain, is it my adhd?, is it simply a severe lack of patience due to my inability to cope with certain things? I lost my father at 17, my best friend 9 months later, my grandfather a year and a half later, and just recently, my stepfather. I wonder if it has to do with any of those things. I hate being this way. There was a time in my life where I had risen above that behavior, but ever since my father passed away, it feels like I’ve been hit with everything. For a few months, I worked for a 62 year old man in heating and air, who did nothing but scream at me, call me useless, etc etc, all because I had some trouble learning a few things. Idk, probably because he yelled at me, instead of teaching me? I was fired from 2 jobs in less than 9 months apart, finding out later that the only reason I was fired from the first, was because a woman in the workplace said “I reminded her of her ex husband” and the second job, because I refused to go full time. I feel like all these experiences in life are being channeled into pure bitterness.

My dog is 14 and slowly on his way out. My mom turns into a massive issue when she’s drunk and she normally starts issues. She’s yelled out the car window many times as my dad drove when she’s drunk. She has been drinking daily again.\n\n\nDecember 14th, once I snapped I realized that I’m not at fault for my issues with reactions and anger even though I hold myself accountable. \n - on that day I realized she is the cause of majority of my issues.

I started to write in my journal again. I had one drink to allow myself to feel depressed and vulnerable with myself. While writing I figured my behavior out, with anger and tears. \n\nI haven’t cried that hard since I was 16 and suicidal. I cried while writing, hyperventilating, shaking, with burst of anger and sadness. I prayed to let God make me feel my pain. I felt it all. In that moment I realized it’s not my fault. It’s hers, and I need to fix my anger before I ruin everything and burn bridges as I’ve always had. \n\nGood Will Hunting - “It’s not your fault.” Scene hit me like a truck.\n\nTo everyone struggling, it’s not always your fault. It can be your environment. It can most definitely be your parents. Just know not everything it’s your fault, but take accountability for those you hurt in your journey. \n\nSelf-righteous behavior and outburst is a losing game. There is no reward behind anger no matter how good and easy that form of venom tastes. Took me two years of hard mental work to get to this point, it’s not easy but life will be more peaceful. You aren’t alone in your internal fight. You aren’t always at fault. \n\nMessage me if you have to. I saw myself old self this month at a church. This guy a year younger than me, he has issues and I saw me in him. I realized not every angry person is a bad guy. No I saw this dude in so much pain and he is running from himself and he’s insecure. He hasn’t accepted himself. I can’t fix him, but maybe I can help him. \n\nKnow not every angry d-bag is a bad guy. Maybe they are in the same pain you’re in. Remember that. December changed me.

    "selftext": "For context, my parents are heavy drinkers. I had plans to go out with my mother tomorrow morning, and she changed the plans immediately. I could already tell with how she was slurring her words that she was drunk. I was mildly upset with the plans changing so suddenly, but it was fine. I was more bothered by the fact that she lied to me. She told me that my brother had deliberately changed our plans, but she actually did and just wouldn't tell me. I asked my brother, and he denied it. I tried asking her why she lied to me, but it wasn't getting through to her. She just kept saying, \"What's the major issue??\" Despite me not actually being upset about the plan change, but upset about the unexpected and unnecessary lies. After maybe an hour of going back and forth over the phone while she talked over me and threw insults at me like, \"You're just like your father!!\" I was crying on the floor, screaming about how much I hate alcohol. I never hated an inanimate object so much before. The amount of rage I felt over a literal liquid was insane. It ruined my family, and I vowed to stay away from it, so I didn't turn into my parents, especially like father, but then it happened. I kicked a hole in my wall. My heel created a circle, and part of the wall fell inwards. It was already too late. I had turned into my father. I had thrown stuff. Yes, it was only a Croc, or maybe a screw. But still. I had already turned into the violent man I never wanted to be. It already hit me that this ab*se was generational, and I tried to avoid it. But holy shit man. I kicked a hole in my wall. The worst I'd do when angry was throw something, maybe like a pillow, nothing enough to cause real damage. But this time I had done it. I had kicked a hole in my own bedroom wall because of anger against an object, or more specifically, anger against my parents. After my anger died down, I was just sitting in disbelief. It genuinely feels silent in my mind. When I did it, it didn't even feel like me. I'm literally disgusted looking back on myself now kicking it, as if I'm witnessing another person's disgusting behaviour. My dad's gonna be pissed, but I'm more devasted over the fact I did it. Reddit isn't the best place of advice, but my god, I need somebody to even give me the smallest amount of it right now. I am disgusted in myself. I want to change. I've tried so hard. This was the very thing I avoided. I told myself, once I grow older and live on my own, they'll be no more angry man to haunt me. But what do I do if that angry man has now embedded himself into my soul and makes me act this way? Please, anybody, just help me out.",

It's no substitute for actual help though and I wanted to enroll in his course for the resources but it's so expensive. I feel if there was an effort to help more people the course wouldn't be so pricey but if it is a truly good resource I would be willing to invest money into it so my life can be better.

    "selftext": "Growing up my parents were always fighting with each other, and they were always trying to fight with me. This was basically 24/7.\n\nThe only way to get the fights to stop was to escalate them - someone would eventually say something so awful that it got us to realize things had gone too far. Then we’d all apologize, hug it out, and a few days later it would start all over again. \n\nAs a result, I got really, really good at arguing and figuring out ways to be hurtful - at picking up on people’s insecurities and weaponizing them. I could do it basically on autopilot, without really feeling anything. It was procedural - fight starts, say something mean but slightly true, wait for the tears and apologies, and go about my day. My parents acted like this was normal. \n\nIn college I brought this dynamic into relationships and friendships, and you can imagine how well that went. I did eventually realize that “making every situation into a nuclear conflict” was a terrible way to live, and in a more peaceful environment I started to relax. \n\nStill, the old me would show up sometimes  and every time it would be damaging to me or to people I care about. So one day - after a particularly bad argument with a girlfriend - I decided that I would just stop getting angry. \n\nAnd it “worked”. I haven’t yelled at anybody in ten years. People who didn’t know teenage me can’t believe I could ever even *be* angry. I come across as quiet, reserved, and awkward. I’m much happier to be that than to be who I was before.\n\nBut, ten years later, I can’t handle any conflict at all. I have so much anxiety around arguing it’s debilitating. Minor disagreement with a coworker? Panic. Someone says something mildly hurtful? Panic. Meeting with a client who wants to debate something innocuous? Panic. \n\nMy communication skills are awful - if there’s even a hint of disagreement I forget how to speak. It’s messed with my career and my relationships, because I can’t express how I feel. I can’t get angry or stay angry at anyone or anything - even in situations where I objectively should be upset. \n\nI don’t miss the anger, but I do miss being able to stand up for myself. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? If so, how did you approach it? \n\n(I’ve been in therapy for 5+ years and while it’s helped me work through a lot of my past it hasn’t helped much with this.)",

They've never affected me as much, like yeah sometimes i would blow up over trivial matters but i didn't realise just how bad the problem was until i first got into a commited relationship. I've been with my partner for two years so far and around halfway through our relationship our honeymoon phase ended and we entered the phase where things get a bit tough in the relationship . I've always had issues with conflict resolution, I'm assuming because a lot of the time when i argued with my parents they didn't take me as seriously and sometimes flat out refused to apologise so a lot of times i enter arguments with that mentality, which either causes me to shut down and become avoidant or it fuels my anger(lately it's been more of the latter). My partner is usually a very calm and collected person during arguments whereas lately i feel like i just cant control my anger whatsoever and i just completely lose control of myself when we argue (not trying to excuse my actions, it genuinely feels like that in that moment). While i have never, and would NEVER, do anything to hurt them physically, when i feel disrespected or like I don't matter to my partner it feels like i can't contain myself from saying really mean things that i don't mean. And i hate it so much because I know that my partner is a really sensitive person and i love that about them so much but it feels like no matter what I can't stay calm during arguments. I've tried looking for advice on the internet (bc I'm a broke uni student and i cant really afford therapy) and all of it is just \"calm down\" \"take a deep breath\" \"meditate\" or whatever and I've tried really hard but it feels impossible to switch my focus from the angry thoughts in that moment. It hurts so much because this has been repeating for a while and I've been promising my partner that i will change and be better, but I feel like I'm no better than before, maybe even worse too. I'm also starting to see a shift in their behaviour where now when we argue they are more mean and cold towards me and i know that it's all my fault and it really hurts.

A while I guess. I'm at my mother's house for our family Christmas. Lots of people, all close intimate family. I was so angry, I still am but it's a little less intense now. I didn't have an outburst or make a scene. But I was just too angry to even speak and it wasn't going away. I needed to get away, and the bathroom was the only real option. I spent a long time just laying on the floor trying to quietly digest my anger. When I get angry I just lose the ability to articulate my thoughts and feelings, which really just makes me angrier since I can't even have a discourse with the person/people I'm upset with. I don't really have outbursts any more, but that just means that I get to be miserable for longer in exchange for not saying something I'll regret. I didn't get to properly say goodbye to my brother and his family when they left, I didn't feel in control enough. Just a short goodbye through the bathroom door. I'm pretty sure I inherited my anger from my Dad. He's cooled off in his old age, but he was an explosive type. Never really crossed the line too much into physical abuse, but it was still terrifying as a kid. I don't think I'm any less angry than he was, but I spent pretty much my entire life not wanting to be that way. As a result, my anger tends to be the quiet, simmering type. Until it's not, but those times are pretty few and far between.  But it doesn't mean I'm any less angry. I may not be yelling or breaking things, but I often wish I could. I wish I could just let myself be angry and be done with it. But I'm a big guy. I don't get to be angry, because big guys are traumaticly scary when they show their anger. And I don't ever want to make someone else feel the way my Dad made me feel as a kid. So now I'm sitting in the bathroom making myself cry by talking about my daddy issues. Honestly, this is better, it's the release I need. I just wish I could rely on this sort of release more often. Crying is so much better than being angry. But I don't know how to let myself cry. All I can do is be glad on the vanishingly rare occasions like this where it just happens. I'm still angry now, but a little less so, which I guess is good. This post is a mess, sorry. I don't even know what I'm trying to say or what I want... maybe this counts as a rant and the mods will delete it. I don't know if that would matter to me, but I do know that writing this helped a little bit, so I'm posting it.",

Its way easier to do a simple transaction at the counter than the security stuff. A customer wanted a ink cartridge on a security box and I had to go to the back of the store to get one. Out of anger/annoyance because I had a whole line of customers waiting on me because this lady couldn’t do a transaction to make it easier, I rough up the box and such. Not break anything but I gripped it hard. I gave her the box back and my anger slipped again saying “those boxes sure beat a 1 minute max transaction at the counter huh?” She clenched her pearls, sicked her husband on me and no management was called but still. My anger comes somewhat from fear. If a task isn’t done it makes my department look bad/me. Ive been so used to being pinned down and treated harshly for things since I was a kid.

Weirdly enough, happy people just kind of make me more angry and I deal with a lot of them at my job. I realize whenever my anger spikes I get really REALLY smart, rude, cocky and such.

And when we couldn't, he got upset and moved away from me and slept. The next morning when I woke up, he asked me to leave because he has to go meet his friends. \n\nHe got a new friend in his office and they became very close instantly. When I used to spend nights in his apartment, he would be busy sending her snaps of his days, she would call him and if I felt bad about it, he would tell me I am being unreasonable. He had sympathy for her cause she was alone in the city but she was dating someone and what about me? I was also alone in the city and I came from another country as well, so I had no one. \n\nHe would also ghost me for days, which led me to be very insecure. So, I decided to check his phone one day and I saw that while he wasn't replying to me ,he was replying to the girl in his office with pictures of where he went and what he did. When I confronted him, he told me they are just friends and I am just being petty. \n\nOnce, when we were having sex, the condom broke and I asked him if we could go buy the pills together, he said No. So I went alone and got it, and I was crying when I had to take the pill because it was a first time for me and I was very scared. To which he told me that I need to just deal with it cause he needs to go to his friend's party. \n\nHe also used to send me to buy condoms cause it was too awkward for him to go on his own. He also said he will cut off his office friend for me if it bothers me so much. I could never trust him after that and I should have broken up and left for good but I stayed. \n\nAnd his office friend that he cut off for me came back and she confessed her love for him and he was talking to her behind my back. All this was happening behind my back, while I was there taking care of him because he had fever and flu. He told me that there is nothing between them and he has told her he doesn't feel the same about her.  \n\nThere was this time I had to go to the hospital to take IV drops and I had reached out to him, if he could be there for me, he said he can't make it cause he has to go hometown, but later I also got to know that he had gone to meet his office friend during the same time I was going through all this. He went to meet that girl after she confessed that she wants to be with him and still I was the one who was thinking in the wrong way. \n\nAnd he was applying to go abroad, when he got his visa he told me he wants to meet me. I treated him well but as soon as he goes home he ghosted me again and called me when he was boarding his flight and gave me shit for not picking up his call cause he was so lonely at that time. As soon as he goes abroad, he starts ghosting me for few days, then he cheats on me. And after doing all this too, when he came back home from a semester break he told me that he came to test me and I haven't changed at all and am not the right fit for him. And he tells me that he wants to be friends with me because I am his best friend. \n\nWhen my uncle committed suicide his first response upon hearing that was \" Do you wanna have sex\" \nI came back from my home to celebrate Valentine's day with him, only for him to tell me he wants to go home and celebrate Valentine's day with his mom and didn't wish me until his office friend made him realise that he has to wish me \n\nI also got some flowers for him on his birthday, it was Covid time so had to do some DIY, only for him to tell me that whatever I did is so sad\nWhen I had my exams he called me cause he was alone, I went to him only for him to kick me out from his house again as soon as I woke up.

At times I am very frustrated with him because sometimes it feels he shows zero gratitude. The other night my mom tracked his location on her phone. He has pretty shitty friends and our condition for letting him use our cars was that 1. We didn’t want him smoking weed in our cars and 2. He could not bring his friends along on rides or anything in our cars. He normally gets home around 1am. 1 am rolled around and he still wasn’t home my parents decided to peek at his location and he was no longer at work. They assumed he was out with his friends being ungrateful and not respecting our rules. They blow up his phone with messages and calls. He gets home around 2 am and screaming as soon as he comes into the house. He is physically shaking with anger. It was a scary sight. He gets into a screaming match with my dad and gets defensive about being accused of going out with his friends and my dad keeps repeating how he has no respect and all this and he just goes into an episode and gets LOUD. We’ve had the cops come to our house several times because neighbors call them due to disturbance. He has even punched holes into our walls before and it can just be scary at times. He’s gotten into physical alterations with my dad as well. I absolutely hate when this happens. It makes me feel angry as well with the way he treats my parents but I also really want to try to understand him and I don’t know how to go about his anger. I don’t know where he got this idea that he can talk to my parents anyway he wants who have helped him get out of so many problems. But sometimes I think he just doesn’t think before he speaks and just gets CRAZY defensive about anything he is accused of. He talked to him about trying to remain calm letting him know I understand how frustrating it can be to be accused of something you didn’t do but explaining that he needs to remain calm because going crazy isn’t going to help his case at all. I’m scared of moving out one day and leaving my parents alone to deal with his anger but I also feel my parents gang up on him at times that it makes me feel major sympathy for him and I love both my parents and brother so much I don’t want to lose either one. Seeing them fight just feels like I’m caught in the middle of everything. I feel the need to protect my parents but also the need to let my brother know I’m here for him. It’s hard to feel bad for him sometimes though knowing how irresponsible he is and how mean and nasty he can get with his anger. He yells swears tells my parents to shut up and just says awful things. I’m scared he’s never going to get over these anger problems. I don’t want him to end up in jail and I don’t want my parents to have to deal with this. He smokes a lot of weed so I never know if his anger is somehow coming from all of that or if he’s just narcissistic or something wanting everything to go his own way. I think my brother may have an addiction to marijuana and is causing him these issues but also I have no idea how that works. I want the best for him I really do it’s just so hard to talk to him. I want the best for my brother and don’t want him to be broke his whole life or going from job to job all the time. My parents obviously care for him so much and it’s sad to hear what he says to them sometimes. What can I do about this? How do I get his anger to be less intense? How can I make this stop forever?",

    "selftext": "I can’t stand people getting shafted at work unfairly. About a year ago my wife fell out of favor with a really bad boss who wanted to replace her simply because they wanted to install a close crony of theirs into her position. My wife is an extremely dedicated person. She’d work overtime, weekends, bring paperwork home with her and basically do everything to please her employer. Despite this they still fired her. Proof of her worth is that they’ve hired three people into her vacated position since that can’t get along with this supervisor. My wife has since gotten a new job and is very happy. I can’t let the anger go.\nCoincidentally at my job, my supervisor is going through the same BS. They’re trying to get her fired by nit-picking every little thing she does and are threatening her with termination. I can’t disassociate myself from the issue because when you criticize my boss, you’re also shitting on the work I do because we work together. \nThe nit-picking is highly unwarranted and petty. I’ve been in this business for 30 years and she’s as good as anyone and better than most, yet they pick on her. I’m seeing the writing on the wall that she’s going to get canned and it’s rekindling all the hatred I have pent up in my heart for my wife’s ex-supervisor.\nI go to work angry all the time. I want to tear someone’s head off their shoulders. I daydream of meeting her supervisor in a dark alley somewhere. I’m so full of hatred and loathing for people that I alternate wanting to injure myself and injure someone else. \nI know hatred and anger is physically detrimental to your health, but I can’t let it go. I feel it’s going to manifest itself in a very negative experience.\nWhat is wrong with me and what can I do to alleviate these feelings of despair and anger??",

Me and my husband has been in so many arguments about our daughters and our granddaughter. \n\nMy daughter is dealing with ppd and around 4-5pm either me or my husband will take the baby to give her a break. I asked my husband to watch the baby for 10-15 minutes so I could fix dinner (it was spaghetti, toast, and corn). The baby pooped on herself and it got on my husband’s pants and he kept saying “You damn bitch! Ya pooped on my pants! Goddam it” I told him not to curse around her because me nor her mother wants her to curse in her early ages. He said “She shit on my motherfuckin pants! What the fuck you mean don’t curse?!?!” My daughter came down and said “Daddy, she’s a baby.” And he said “To hell with it. I have newborn shit on me.” And my daughter took the baby and cleaned her up while I helped my husband. \n\nBut that motherfuckin shit he pulled was just so annoying and now he’ll look at her saying “You shit on my fuckin pants.” Like nigga ok we get it but she’s a baby it’s bound to happen and because you’re a grandpa you don’t need to be all old man grump about it. She peed and poo on me before and I didn’t yell or anything at her because she’ll cry. I understand how he feels but goddam!! \n\nUpdate: \nI did what y’all advised me to talk to him when we were both calm and I did. I asked him “Bae, why did you overreact about what she did?” And he said “I ain’t the fucking father of that damn baby. I ain’t finna take that shit all cute and adorable” and I told him “Nobody asked you to. But yelling at the baby wasn’t the right way either.” He said “Bella (my daughter) never should’ve been having sex, never should’ve not used a condom, never should’ve kept this child and if she didn’t this wouldn’t be happening,” and I said “Look, there’s nothing we can do about the whole “she had unprotected sex” but we’re the grandparents of Heaven (our granddaughter) you cannot yell at her like that.” He said “Well, she’s living in the house for free so..” and I told him “she’s a baby out baby’s baby.” And he said “Well tell her to stop fucking and then we won’t have anymore problems.” And I asked him what did he mean and then he kept repeating the same thing “Bella never should’ve been having sex, never should’ve not used a condom, never should’ve kept this child and if she didn’t this wouldn’t be happening.” He keeps talking about how he’s mad at her but I keep trying to tell him that I understand how he feels but there’s nothing we can do about her being a teen mother. He refuses to talk to our daughter and refuses to even live on our grand baby. She’s not even a month old yet and she’s already being hated and not even just now hated but by her papa. ",

    "selftext": "# \n\n# \n\nim an adult and still have an issue about knowing how to respond to people who plot to wrong me and do it. I always get froze up and have absolutely nothing to say to them who mistreat me. then i let them get the best of me. Just like what happened today with this bus driver who blocked me from getting on. Bus drivers were having a changeover and i was standing by the bus stop before anybody else. And the bus driver who was coming on, came to the bus stop a couple of mins after i was already standing there. He got on the bus and couldnt get on the bus til like 5 mins later. More people started coming up waiting by the bus. The driver eventually opened the doors and i came on first. There's 3 steps up to get on the bus. as soon as i made my first step on he said \"she was waiting first\" and kept repeating that while pointing at this woman in the line as i kept stepping up on the bus. Then i made my way up and he blocked the isle and repeated himself again. Firstly, I was the 1st person at the stop, and wtf does it matter who waited first as long as everybody gets on. EVen the woman was saying \"it doesnt really matter\" but i sttod there first and he came to the bus to do the handover after some people was already waiting for the bus. but he lied and made this shit a big deal about who waited first.. this is the response i wish i couldve gave him and i wish i couldve threatened to report him or force my way on the bus because what he did was an injustice. instead, i said nothing and turned around and got off the bus as he was blocking the way of entry with his arm. I always let people make a bitch out of me. i let them punk me. and im so infuriated with that worthless muthufucking bus driver. im mad at myself for freezing up as i always do and thinking about what i shouldve said mins after the incident is over. how do i respond to this type of shit with people next time and not freeze up and have a brain fog. I knew he was wrong from the beginning. thats why i kept making my way up the steps as he repeated himself 3 times. I just didnt want to be confrontational and let him be right in the end because he's the bus driver and he has all the authority on the bus. i guess i wouldnt win that battle anyway and just do what he says regardless.",

The guy who used to bully me, picked up a ball while we were on sport class, pretended twice that he will throw it at me, i was flicnhing all the time while others laughed at me, and when u turned around, he thrw it at me twice, i managed to took the ball from him, but for some reason i gave it back to him, so he throwed it at me again, that felt absolutly horrendus, all my self esteem and confindce went away because i had so many options to hit him, or just do sometimes about him, but i did not, so i decided, that i will hit him next time he does something, well today, going to the gym with my friend (not trying to be racist here, and im sorry if i offend someone) 3 gipsies were sitting, vapeing in the changing room, and they started making random noises to scare us, i know that they did this only to scare us beacause they were laighing about it, we went down to lift and i was thinking about not letting that slide becuase i had enough of me not being able to stand up for myself, they didnt lifted anything that we did, they were a lot waeaker then us, and their form was horrendus, when we came back, to the changing room, they were all sitting in the dark, probably they tried to scare us, again, but we didnt even moved a bit, not now, or when we went in there with them for the first time, they asked where we lived, we said around here, they asked my friend how long he been lifting, he said like half a year, they looked suprised, i tought that they will say something like, you dont seem like it, some info about where i live, i live in serbia and in not a great place, and im also hungarian and dont speak serbian very well, when i told them i dont know how to explain something in serbian, one of them started speaking very bad hungarian and told me that they will drive us home, i told him that we will walk its okay, but i felt this was a sing of mockery, but they said that they were just fucking with us before, (my mind was only thinking about that i didnt stood up for myself yesterday, and i have to now) so i told him, that what they did wasnt funny, he turned to a straight looking face, \"we did what\", he asked and i told him, what he did before, the asked the same question, i said whatever, he stood up, took his shirt off, looked life he wanna fight me, but he and his friend started laughing, at the same time, when we went out of the changing room, i told my friend,\"i guess we wont go home with a car\" and started laughing a bit, they i hear the guy say \"what did you say?\" in a loud voice, then i heard a strong door opening and closing, we did not turn around, and we walked away, im sure they were just trying to scare us, but we did not show any sign of fear, but now, the fear got to me, what if i get beaten up, where i live, there are a lot of gipsies, so i can get killed too, but people i talked to, and my friend said that they wont do shit, which i belive (and hope too). So yea i felt like i wanted to get this off my chest, the only togher time i tired to stand up for myself, i might have gotten myself into possibly getting beaten up, man im so fucking unlucky and retarded.\n\nEdit: Im so mad at myself, i caused conflict for no reason, i couldve just walked away, without any problems, fuck im so mad at myslef i actually cant belive it. And now i might get beaten up because of this, there is a chance i can get beaten up my their friends too while im going home from school, im such a dumb fuck.",

    "selftext": "I’ve gotten a heck of a lot better over the years at redirecting my anger, or being able to step back from the situation that’s causing it, things like that. Mindfulness can help a lot and I have the skills to deal with big feelings more often than not. \n\nBut there are just some circumstances that leave me unable to find those tools, or honestly unwilling to use them. Last evening was one of them. I couldn’t find something, a few things, but it became focused on this one thing, a bag in which I knew I had something sentimental. I’ve moved about three times this past year, and there have been several instances in which I can’t find things that I know I packed up and moved with but which seem to have disappeared. It makes me feel insane. I go crazy just knowing the object is SOMEWHERE but I have nearly run out of places to look. \n\nThis scenario is really hard for me. In other contexts it can be easier to accept a lack of control and move on, but when I lose something, especially tied to moving which was stressful for me? I struggle so, SO much to let it go. I HAVE to find the thing. It’s maddening - and in a way almost addicting, too. I’m justified in being angry because, well, it sucks to lose things!!\n\nHowever it’s not justifiable to get so angry that I’m pushing things around, venting sarcastically to myself, and needing to take breaks to hit the heavyweight bag with blind rage - all of this I did last night. It seems unhealthy… or is it? This is what I struggle with. Even in these times I feel like I’m able to keep the anger within certain boundaries, and express it relatively healthily. But unfortunately my roommates still witnessed this - and expressed “worry” about me and my “anger issues” afterwards. How can I disagree with them? Even if it was healthier or more controlled, I still had a fit of rage and struggled to contain it. I don’t want that in my life or the lives of my loved ones. \n\nIf I hadn’t found the object I’d been looking for, I don’t know how I ever would have calmed down. I’m sure I would have found solace in music, art, all those other more healthy coping mechanisms instead of letting anger take hold “healthily” as I did. It can be addicting in the moment. But I just feel embarrassed today. Even though I found what I was looking for, now it’s tied to that rage, too.\n\nI want to be better. I also want to forgive myself for being angry. I can see all the compounding reasons why I got so upset. I just couldn’t let it go. Despite all my progress there are still moments like that. I need to remember this shame going forward and use the memory as an e-brake on future outbursts. People don’t deserve to witness that. I wish I’d been alone.. just wanted to vent to an understanding space.",

I should also add im not violent, and i would never resort to it.\nFor context: I (20 f) love animals, and especially cats. I adopted my first cat a few years ago to help with my depression. In short, he helped me pull myself together, and saved me from commiting suicide. My cat is everything to me and id endure anything for him.\nMy love for cats has become so intense though that its started to cross into unsettling. \nI was on youtube tonight, and youtube decided that because i watch a ton of cat related content, it'd recommend a cat torture video. The thumbnail and title alone sent me into this weird shock. I immediately reported and marked as \"dont show me this\", but it was too late by then.\nI knew that YT had a problem of animal torture videos, but id never come into contact with them. \nSince i saw this, all i can think about is what violent acts I'd do to the men in the video. My thoughts terrify me. Even though ive tried watching positive/funny things, took a shower, anything i could think of to ease my mind.\nIve never really experienced intense anger before. I dont know how to handle it or let it go. But everytime i encounter something like this, my hatred and disappointment towards humanity overwhelms me. To know that this suffering exists everywhere and is constantly happening makes me feel hopeless and angry that i cant really help.\nI really hope im not crazy, or alone with this.

    "title": "I'm scared, and need advice",
    "selftext": "To summarize as much as possible: I grew up in a very angry household. I'm currently 22 now, and my family has a long history with anger. From domestic abuse that my relatives had faced and also inflicted on others. To emotional abuse from anger and violence that continues today- anger has always followed my family around.\n\nMy household isn't perfect but we try our best, and anger feels like a member of the family at this point. Constantly there is the throwing of objects, breaking of glass, threats of murder and violence towards one another, some physical violence, and more that stem from unhealthily managed anger. One of my earliest memories of anger in my house, was when I was a kid and my father and uncle almost murdered one another. Hearing everything while my sibling and I hid, as we were told to call the cops and stay quiet, by another relative trying to keep them separated.\n\nMy history in relationships isn't great either. I've survived relationships with domestic abuse and other forms of abuse and thought I came out okay- and I was always scared of becoming like some of my family or my exes- so I never let myself get angry or carefully tried to manage it by keeping it under wraps. \n\nAfter my most recent break-up, where I was abandoned on my birthday, 3 hours out in the middle of nowhere with no support. I was devastated, then after a few months, I got mad. Then I just kept getting angrier. I thought that I never wanted to be on the receiving end of a violent hand ever again. And if I had to choose, that I'd much rather be in their position than to be the one to be beat again. I thought it was just so unfair that I did my best to manage myself and that despite that I'd still be mistreated and scared all the time by  people who didn't care to just fly off the handle.\n\nMy recent break-up was definitely my  breaking point. I just thought, if no one around me manages themselves, why the fuck should I? I don't want to have to baby those around me who can't manage themselves for the rest of my life.\n\nI started to become irate and blowing up randomly over just about anything. At first I felt kind of reasonable for my reaction in these situations, like if I were catcalled or touched inappropriately by someone I'd start cursing them out and screaming at them. That was how it started. While it did feel good to stand up for myself, I feel like I'm taking it too far now. This has escalated to me shoving, and tripping people during these sorts of situations too. Then after letting my anger out like that, it started becoming more unjustified in response to certain situations. Someone bumping into me, someone saying something in a tone I didn't perceive in a good way, etc. I'd just start blowing up on people randomly, and it has just been getting worse and worse. I'm doing a lot of the behaviors I've seen my family and exes do and I'm just horrified about it. I'm so quick to flare up after doing this for a month or two that I sometimes don't even realize what went down until I've calmed myself.\n\nI'm a lot quicker to blow-up on someone if they did something I deem disrespectful to someone I care about too. Someone shoved one of my baby cousins and I cursed her out, and yelled at this older lady because of that. While I don't agree with her shoving a child out of the way, I definitely could've handled it better. After that my baby cousin tried to console me and tell me she was okay. Even though she was the one who got shoved, she was comforting me. I felt like shit. It reminded me of what I did for older aggressive family members, having to comfort them for their anger. Like if they threw something at me and injured me, I'd have to comfort them about it afterwards. Seeing her do things similar to what I did when I was her age just absolutely broke me. I cried about it when I was alone. I don't want her to feel scared by me, and she was. I never wanted a child to console me when they should be the one getting checked on, it felt like my role had reversed in the situation and I was disgusted with myself. I apologized to her immediately after I realized what I'd done- and we talked about what happened. But this made me realize I might be going too far into a direction that I'm scared I don't know how to walk back from.\n\nI just feel so stuck. There is anger and violence at my job, daily. When I go home it is to more anger and violence. Every single day there is anger and violence around me, and now it has found its way inside. I feel like I can't get away from it and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I'm able to catch myself, barely, and I take deep breaths and just remove myself from the situation.\n\nAll of this started because I never wanted to feel small and helpless again, but I didn't want to make others feel small and helpless as a result. This has just gotten out of hand and I'm scared I'll never get the kinder version of myself back. I don't want to scare the ones I love. That goes for the ones with their mishandled anger too, I still love them in some way or another.\n\nThere has to be some sort of better way to handle all of this. I'm just so scared of becoming an abuser, and I'm going to bring it up to my therapist. But those of you that might understand what I'm going through and can help to offer advice, it would mean a lot to me. I'm trying to look into books I can read on the side, as I've found reading to be helpful with figuring out how I might manage the things I'm struggling with. But I just don't know where to begin, I feel so lost and scared. To whoever took the time to read this, thank you. I hope the holiday season is good to you, it can be hard.\n",

He has always been like this to some degree but now he is very unwell (due to stress and I blame his lack of motivation/accountability to take care of his own health, mum has to remind him to take his meds!). He is recovering from multiple surgeries and heavily reliant on my mum. \nSo to some degree for the last couple of years the dependence on my mum is necessary. \nMy mum however just allows to be walked all over, very few times does she speak up for herself. I believe my mum loves the 'care-taker' role (to a degree). 🤢\nI have been trying to not get angry and cause a scene because it takes two to tango, my mum is an adult and she can put her foot down and set boundaries if she wanted to, and I believe if she had years ago, my dad wouldn't be so dependent. \nAnd I don't thinks his behaviour bothers my mum the way it bothers me, I can't handle the yelling or the name calling, its makes me super anxious and angry. \n\nLast time I went over my dad kept telling her what to do (stuff that he probs wanted to do himself but can't, not bothering to notice that my mum is burnt out.) After some time during the day I couldn't even look at my dad. I'm just ashamed. \nHe doesn't say please or thank you. My mum still works full time, he doesn't work. I'm worried my mum will be sick one day because he has drained her. His choices aren't just impacting him, it impacts my mum and one day it'll impact me too, either i'll be taking care of him earlier or taking care of my mum because she is burning out. \n\n\nHow do I let go of this anger? How do I manage this?? \nI can't change him, I can't change my mum. I have tried so many different ways to offer one or both support and little changes. It's their relationship. \n\nI should note - my dad loves my mum, they just have a very dependent/carer relationship.  \n",

    "selftext": "Background: My eldest son is in his early 30's, and works hard. He's doing 10 plus hours a day, 6 days a week, some of it heavy manual, some of it delivering, some of it customer facing. He loves his work, but he's then too tired for anything else. \n\n\nWhen he younger, he got angry very easily. He'd get into arguments if he thought someone was 'dissing' him,  or if he felt something was unjust. He spoke to the doctor about it, and they put him on medication (can't recall the name, but it was a long word that begins with 'E' that his best friend was on for his epilepsy) which made his moods extreme. When he was happy, he was too happy for people to cope with. When he was angry, he'd want to \"rip some f'ing c**ts head off\".\n\n\nHe's been with his fiancé for about 13 years now. She anchors him and it's beautiful to see how much they adore each other. But he's just told me he's struggling. He's angry all the time, like he was before. He hasn't been able to pinpoint any triggers. I'm not sure if he's spoken to his fiancé about this, but if he's anything like he was before, I'm certain she will have noticed it.  I suggested doing an e-consult with the doctor as he doesn't have anyone to cover going to the surgery, but he thinks they will just want to put him back on the medication that gave him the extreme mood swings. \n\n\nSo I'm reaching out here. Is there anyone who's had experience of extreme anger, and been able to deal with it? How did you cope? Is there such a thing as an anger support group like AA for alcoholics? Basically, is there any advice that I can pass on that could help?\n\nUK specific help if it's support groups, etc., but I'll take any advice I can. Thank you. ",

I've dealt with extreme anger issues and feeling a sense of wanting to kill people before I even learned the word murder, as I grew up I wouldn't tell anyone these feelings because I was embarrassed of sounding edgy, I thought it was an emo phase every kid went through. I would see memes or people making jokes about kids wanting to kill their families over minor inconveniences so I just thought I was the same way and that I'd grow out of it. \n\nI know I'm not done maturing yet but it doesn't look like it's getting any better. Most of the thoughts are almost always towards my mom. There are times when I hear her hitting or screaming at my brother or our pets when I have thoughts of grabbing the scissors I have in my room and just stabbing her over and over again. Sometimes I'll use those same scissors and stab my pillows until I'm too tired to feel angry anymore. It's not like I don't love her, she's my mother so I kinda have to, but the first emotion that comes to my head when I think of her is just anger.\n\nI only really leave the house maybe once a month if I'm lucky. I'm homeschooled and am not allowed to go anywhere unless it's to go to the bank with my mom or something and she doesn't want to leave me alone at home. I often feel this feeling of claustrophobia or building up pressure from within me that makes the \"wanting to kill\" feeling so much worse, especially when I hear her voice. I just want to take my aggression out on something. I can't scream or throw stuff because our walls are thin and I don't want her to yell at me. There are so many other numerous issues we have and I just feel so trapped, I feel like the only way to stop feeling like this is if I either kill her or myself",

I can't stand when other people are in a bad mood around me. I snap at the smallest things and yell, swear, throw objects. I lose control briefly and then feel guilty immediately afterwards. I'm afraid my wife will get fed up and leave me. Things I have tried:\n\nSSRIs. I have tried 3 different ones. They all make me super apathetic. Things I know I love to do are now a chore. The anger is still there, has not helped at all. I'm currently weaning off escitalopram with no intention of trying another antidepressant.\n\nQuit alcohol. I was a daily heavy drinker. I have not had a drop of alcohol in 11 months. \n\nSought therapy. I saw a therapist for 5 sessions before she told me she was moving on in her career and that therapy should not be a long term goal. $500 later and I'm not sure if it helped or not. I did get some valuable tools, but I have a hard time deploying them in the time of an anger attack.\n\nBooks and audio books. I've listened to multiple audio books. Some very insightful (Rage: Overcoming explosive Anger was my favorite). I find these books give a great overview of what anger is, why we get angry, etc. however when it comes to actual tools to help stop anger or manage it I have not found any books to be very useful.\n\nPsychedelics. Psilocybin is a mental reset button for me, although only useful in moderation. It seems to give me a few days of mental clarity, but I seem to always swing back into the old mindset fairly quick.\n\nSo I'd really just love to read anyone's experience with anything that has helped them. Medication, supplements, apps, books, meetings, etc. whatever has helped in any way please share with me I'm willing to try anything, thank you.",

    "selftext": "I was thinking;  \nAs humans we incline to dislike pain and unpleasant sensations.  \nAnger is basically a response to change/remove/resist something you don't want.  \nThe way anger does this is by being unpleasant or painful, either physically, mentally or emotionally.  \nThe anger can now use itself as fuel for sustenance and/or growth. Looping back to the start.\n\nIf we have the insight that anger´s purpose is aversion and resistance, and it needs aversion and resistance for it to survive; all we have to do is to deliberately practise being at ease with- and to be kind to the experience of anger, and it´ll burn itself out.\n\n~~Your thoughts?~~\n\nEDIT: After deliberation, the previous statements are deficient. Instead my opinion is now the following:  \nAnger is a response to perceived or real threat.  \nAnger pressures you to react but does not demand it.  \nBy blindly reacting to anger, or suppressing it you learn to avoid strong emotion and develop potentially harmful behavior.  \nThis can lead to a vicious cycle of reactivity (thoughts, feelings and behaviour) that no longer takes into account what is happening in the here and now.  \nBy avoiding intense emotion we don't get to see what they are trying to tell us, and discover that they will pass.\n\nComments appreciated.",

I would rather be overweight than miserable and angry all the time. However my body image affects my self esteem which affects my anger, so it feels like a no-win situation. I’m wondering if anyone who has anger issues has successfully dieted and lost weight without sacrificing their mental health in the process.\n\nI know that staying consistently within a calorie deficit is the most important part of losing body fat. I’m 25F, 62.5 inches tall, and if I try to eat anything less than 1700 calories (at approx 80g protein per day) I get tired, irritable, snappy, and pissed off. It’s not a way that I can live long-term. I can maintain a deficit of 1700 calories for a few weeks along with a workout routine, but something eventually disrupts it (usually an illness) and I lose all my progress. I’ve gained 35lb since 2020 when I started a remote job, despite having many stints of diets during those years. I see in the fitness subreddits that some people my height can survive eating only 1300 calories per day and don’t go insane with hangry rage the way I do when I eat that little.

My mom always maintained this Identity of a strong empowered female, one Who would never let something bad happen to her kids. So when I started realizing that my dad and siblings were hurting me and it was bad-- I didn't understand why she would let this bad thing happen to me. As an adult, I understand that who you want to be and who you are are very different people.\n\nBut when I was little I internalized the message that this must not be bad. Or I must be bad and therefore I deserve this. She left me to fend for myself. But always pretended like she was 100% there for me. This caused a real split for me, One side was very sad and just convinced that I was nothing if I couldn't handle being beaten up and brought to the edge of death again and again while also maintaining that 3.8 gpa. \n\nI always wanted to understand, So when I went to college I went for psychology. Once I started to understand, I realized that it wasn't my fault, My mom was failing me, I had no family, I was on my own, I suffered a kind of personality split. One very angry, Who just wanted to get the fuck away from these people, To take care of herself.\nAnd the other, the thing they created. \n\nA slave, really.

The reason for this was because after not sleeping an entire night I was trying to get some sleep around 5PM. He was blasting terrible rap music and yelling at his daughter (my little cousin). At this point all rational thinking was non existent. I was so angry I just wanted some sleep. (My uncle is an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac, but he isn’t a violent alcoholic, just lazy and inconsiderate) I stormed out of my room and confronted him. He was in a bad mood and shoved me a tiny bit then I shoved him 10x harder to where he flew towards the bed frame. Prior to this event, I’ve talked to him peacefully and rationally about cutting his drinking. But every weekend Fri-Sunday he gets so drunk and trashes my house. This month of November was particularly stressful for me. I’ve struggled with insomnia for 5 years. I’ve never done something like this before and I know insomnia isn’t the reason for this, rather the catalyst. I have other problems I struggle with, especially anger, and not sleeping just brings out all the terrible qualities in me. I apologized after and we hugged and had a deep talk. He knew that I had a lot on my plate, especially since I have the duty to take care of an entire house after my 24 year old brother passed away from sui cide last year. The owner of the house lives in another country and my uncle lives in the backyard room. Im feeling very guilty and ashamed of myself for deciding to take out my anger on my uncle who honestly didn’t even do anything bad. I also am ashamed for picking a fight with someone who’s 80Lbs lighter than I am. I want to get help from a therapist but im not sure if that’ll work. ",

I would feel very tired and like a huge weight was being bared on me, lots of depressive thoughts, until I just snapped.\n\nIn the moment it felt so great, freeing, like I didn’t have to act in a way that I’m not, I just felt like I was finally in control of myself and I could let go.

They even bring up sometimes how terrible I’ve been to them when I’m angry and make it sound like it happens all the time, when in reality it happened maybe twice in the 1 1/2 years I’ve worked with them and even in the situations i got mad i never said anything actually bad, they were just offended by my tone of voice. \nThey didn’t heed my one request though and kept making these jokey comments through out the day about how I’m such a killjoy for not wanting to play cards or how it’s so funny how easily they could get a rise out of me today and just generally not respecting my one boundary i had explicitly given them to protect everyone’s feelings. Then, at the end of the day while we were already leaving, i just completely lost it at my closest friend of the group. Like, threw my shit around in the hallway and everything. I left immediately afterwards and cried the entire way home. \nI tried to apologize via text but she just basically told me that i was really shitty to her and that it was totally uncalled for. I reminded her that i told her that exactly this would happen first thing in the morning to which she replied that she just wanted to help me and cheer me up. And now I'm just so mad at her: for not respecting my decision, for not taking my emotions serious and also for idk daring to get mad at me for exploding at her when i warned her of the outcome? Like I’m sorry i did and i told her so but still. I get that she was just trying to comfort me, but she kinda did it in the worst way possible.  \nI don’t know what to do now.

    "selftext": "I (23M) have been living at home whilst completing my undergraduate, and now my post-graduate degrees and for the last year or so I have found that I am getting increasingly angry with my parents. I'd like to preface this by saying I love them dearly and I recognise how much they have done for me, I am so so so grateful to them. But I also get so angry - and I can't control it. \n\nMy parents are both in their late 50s and they need control, down to every minute detail. The washing up, the bins, the laundry, the cooking, must all be done in a certain way, the kitchen must be spotless 24/7 otherwise there's an argument. Because I do a lot of independent study at home and they need me to help them as theyre getting older, I help out where I can but sometimes they assume I'm doing nothing. They assume I'm lazy and incapable because I have a different sleep schedule when I work for 10+ hours every day doing uni work. Yes, it isn't the most physically taxing work but it's mentally exhausting. \n\nThese arguments will spur out of the littlest things, it's like I unconciously do not process my reaction until afterwards, but I just get so angry. Little miscommunications or comments send me into such anger and I'm not sure why. I am not like this with anyone else, only my parents. My running theory is I never learned how to appropriately manage my anger as a child + I'm ready to move out. I stay at home because it is where my two jobs are + it's far more economically viable, and my course finishes in September, so I've not got long. \n\nI understand that this is my problem, but it should also be acknowledged how angry my mum can get, she gets stressed so easily (which is why she tried so hard to be in control), and after 23 years I think I'm so fed up of having to mould myself to her standards. She can also be prone to playing the victim. This is infuriating. Additionally, both my parents do not know how to listen. I used to try to explain how I feel calmly - but this never worked. Nothing changed so I started to get angrier and shoutier, and now we're here, and they just never listen, no matter how many times I've tried to talk to them about how I feel. This is made worse by them flat out ignoring or laughing at me when I do get angry, which makes me more angry! And afterwards, they so openly bitch about me without even trying to be quiet. \n\nI know I am privileged and I probably sound like a spoiled brat, but I feel like they have this idea of me now. Of what I am like. And this won't change.  No matter what I say or do, no matter how much I show I care, or do everything they ask of me - it's never enough or its undermined by something as little as sleeping before doing the washing up. It feels like they have this idea that I'm lazy, dumb, and incapable, and that they always know better. It is infuriating that they treat me like a child - and maybe that's why I still have tantrums like one lmfao. \n\nI don't even know why I'm posting this, I just want to know how to hold my tongue better, how to stop seeing red so easily ig.

He takes care of her when he can, but it still feels uneven. He’s also had no sex drive since the beginning of our relationship, and he doesn’t enjoy socializing much, while I’m more outgoing.\n\nThat said, I know I’m not perfect either. He often tells me I complain too much and can’t control my anger. I’m critical of him, and he says it’s making life miserable. This was a problem in my previous 6-year relationship, which ended when my ex just left one day.\n\nNow, my partner says he’s drawing a line: whenever I get angry, he’ll ignore me for one day, then two, and so on until separation unless I see a psychologist for my anger. I’ve been to psychologists before, but it hasn’t helped me manage my anger. I don’t even know what kind of treatment I need.\n\nThere’s a lot going on right now—we’re moving house, considering IVF, and I recently had a miscarriage.

I got more remorses that hit harder in these moments, i got worse empathy, lower tolerance about frustration or something that i'm not confortable. Etc.\n\nI really like videogames and i play online games but this change of behaviour it's very noticeable on games. When i loose in the better cases i just ragequit but in the worse i used to send slurs and fake reporting whoever eliminated me. I abandoned that particular game for about 5 months but then when i was playing other online games i was doing the same exact thing. I figured out that i was feeling that looses like something personal, because it's different when a bot or a npc eliminates me bc it's programed with a certain difficulty or aim because i don't have this type of frustration in offline games but with a normal match it's other person doing that. Instead of just attemptong one more time i can't handle the anger and i even self-harm myself. \n\nSelf-harm it's one more of my anger problems, not just in games in other situation when i'm alone like discussing with my family makes me veri angry and my method to calm down is just going to my room, closing the door and self harm myself with punches o marking me with some sharp object, i still have some scars of that situations. \n\nI was almost expelled from my institute for fighting. Some dude that i \"stealed\" his girl, i don't even care about them but he was pissed bc i was trying to contact her just to apologize and broke contact with her bc she was getting me in trouble with my parents bc her sister knows my mom. But ofc he found out and then he was trying to confront me. I was super reasonable, I tried to explain to him even showing him evidence and without getting upset but he was mad asf telling me to fight and that broke my patience, he was smaller than me and i almost broke his nose. \n\nI hate being watched, i hate doing somebody's stuff only if it's not very important, i hate awful kids, in my freelance work i feel very unconfortable when i know somebody in my house is listening my calls or meetings i don't feel with the enough privacy, it's worse when i'm playing and somebody enter to my room searching for something. \n\nIdk what i gotta do.

However, I (20M) have recently gotten rather severe anger issues in the context of my girlfriend (2 year long relationship so far). None of my past relationships had this issue, but also this is my first real love so maybe thats a factor. Why is this? My first thought is resentment, but after any sort of argument I always look back and think \"i didnt have to get angry\". Many of the times i feel misunderstood, and I never start something angry, its always something she says that triggers it. I really hate this part of me, and have been taking steps to learn myself to prevent it from happening further along with therapy. Many of the times its a lack of communication on my end, something I've always struggled with her",

I suggested few solutions, such as whenever she gets emotional we take 5 minutes away from each other, I tell her that she is about to be irrational and tell her to stop before she starts, think more than one minute before she say anything that’s in her mind, etc. But it doesn’t work because once she is upset she loses control and forgets all the rules we set. Also she gets extra grumpy when I wake her up from sleep. She would throw tantrums while she’s half asleep and then forgets all about it when she awakens later. I try to understand that it is hard to control herself and most of the hurtful things are not exactly what she meant to do but it’s mentally exhausting for me.

    "selftext": "# When it comes to our emotions, we tend to usually justify why we do what we do. \n\nThe **problem** with that is that there are conflicts of interest. In those cases, we’re the defendant, we’re the prosecutor, and we’re the judge. \n\nThe reason this is a problem is because we tend to have the ability to quickly know when people have taken things with us too far. However, we don’t always seem to be as sensitive when we’ve gone too far with others!\n\nTake Mario, for instance…\n\nMario and Nilsa have been dating for three years and have one child together. For the most part they both work great as a team providing for their family. However, whenever Mario feels like Nilsa isn’t giving him enough attention, he gets angry and becomes abusive. It’s gotten so bad that when Nilsa lost her aunt and didn’t answer her cell phone because she was out mourning with other family members, Mario took a bat to their 70-inch television.\n\nOnce she made it home and saw the damage, she asked him what happened. When he told her he flipped out because she was ignoring his calls, it bothered her and she let him know how selfish he was acting. This fueled Mario’s anger even more. Consequently, he hauled off and hit her in the mouth knocking out her front tooth. \n\nTruth is, Mario was being selfish, but he felt somewhat justified because of how Nilsa’s comment made him feel. Clearly, he was out of pocket, but initially he didn’t really think so.\n\nIt wasn’t until the next day when his anger was completely settled that he realized he may have overreacted and apologized to her for what he did. However, the damage was already done, and **Nilsa’s tooth** was not going to grow back because now he was sorry about it. \n\nAlthough Mario promised to work overtime to pay for Nilsa to get a replacement, Nilsa has to experience unnecessary shame and embarrassment. Not only does she have to attend her aunt’s funeral without her front tooth, but her family members are going to want to know why all of a sudden, her tooth is missing.\n\nMario really does care for Nilsa the best he knows how. However, they can’t have what they really want, which is a loving, healthy family. \n\nNilsa believes its worth sticking it out with Mario because he told her he really wants to be a good boyfriend and father. And although that may be true, Mario becoming a good boyfriend and father because he said he wants to be is as probable as a lemon seed growing up to become a pine tree. What she doesn’t realize is that until Mario deals with the underlining issues of his anger they are never going to have the loving, healthy family they want because the true elements of love and health are just not there! \n\n***So, what’s really going on with Mario?***  \n\nMario is full of anger! And truthfully, his angry outburst had nothing to do with Nilsa. She’s just the closest to him! \n\nThe real issue is that he hasn’t dealt with his past trauma, yet! \n\n**THE BACK STORY:**\n\nIn high school, Mario was an amazing basketball player. In his senior year, he was able to convince a few college coaches to come watch him play. If recruited, he would have received a full-ride scholarship. \n\nDuring that game, he went up for a rebound. But when his feet hit the ground again, he felt something like a shot in the heel followed by a snap. Crumbling to the floor, he grabbed for his left ankle. Soon enough, he learned that he had ruptured his Achillies tendon and couldn’t play ball for two consecutive years.\n\nThe truth is Mario is resentful about his missed opportunity in high school and believes that had he not injured his heel, his life would be better. So, whenever he feels like he’s being pushed to the side, he becomes triggered because it takes him back to the time he’d been pushed to the side after he injured his heel. \n\nTo Mario’s defense, he has tried to fix his anger.  He’d bought a book on how to control it and did try some of the techniques which helped for a while but wasn’t effective for long. Then someone suggested that he buy a punching bag to punch when he got angry.  All that did was train him to only be satisfied when he hit something, which is, honestly, why he ended up hitting Nilsa in the mouth. \n\nThe reason these techniques don’t work is because neither are dealing with the root issue. \n\nFor us Believers, we are told in scripture to get rid of our bitterness, wrath, and anger (Ephesians 4:31-32).  This means that it is actually in our power to get rid of these things!\n\n**Mario** can only fix his anger when he decides to let go of his resentment toward life! Resentment is a combination of anger, frustration, and disappointment. The only way Mario can let go of his resentment is by first letting go of the belief that the high school opportunity was the only good opportunity he could have ever head. Then he’d need to let go of his old dream and simply dream up a new one!\n\n***Rock with Me now…***\n\nWith the human experience, we get the freedom of choice. However, depending on what side of life we find ourselves on, we see this choice as either a curse or a blessing.\n\nOur freedom to choose allows us to choose the path we take in life. Plan A is the human plan, the plans we make. Plan B is God’s plan, the plan He had in mind for us when He sent us here to live on earth.\n\nThe thing is, when we choose our plan, Plan A, we’re pretty much on our own. That means, we have to fight to make it happen. \n\nWhat we don’t always have knowledge of are the spiritual things that causes interference. These interferences can include family curses, demonic influences, spiritual soul ties, and the power of our words.\n\nIn God’s plan, Plan B, He takes care of everything. Our only job is to develop a close relationship with Him, which is our protection, and **willingly obey** as He leads and guides us. The challenge with God’s plan is that it’s often times things we don’t want to do, or that we don’t feel qualified enough to do. But He qualifies those He calls and makes provision for what He approves. And in the end, we get the most out of the life that God plans for us, now and forever more!\n\n",

About 2.5 months ago I became extremely angry for the first time in my life (my sister doing some very dumb shit during her divorce that hurt our side of the family and her kid) and unlocked a new \"achievement\" - high blood pressure during rage.\n\nNow even a small thing that makes me angry for like 5 minutes will raise my blood pressure continuously for hours. For example, earlier today I got very minimally angry because my gf was demanding some unrealistic stuff and during the anger itself my blood pressure raised a bit. That's the normal part, right...  What's not normal is that even hours after the anger has resolved, the high blood pressure continues. \n\nI have verified this effect with a blood pressure monitor several times. My normal bp is 130/85 (a bit high but I am overweight). Somehow my blood pressure will elevate to around 150-160/100 and will stay there for hours long after I've finished being angry.\n\nWhat fixes it is enough time or alcohol. Drinking a beer or two will normalize my blood pressure quickly. Until I get even minimally angry again for some reason lol.\n\nAnyone else had lingering high blood pressure after even a short anger episode?",

I am usually responding to other people's posts but today i got angry and I want to talk about it and like so many of us, i have nobody in my life right now that i feel will listen and not make me more upset, so here i am.\n\nI feel like i was \"set up\", many things just had to happen in a certain order to force me into a conflict that i went to lengths to avoid, and i did try, but as i say my efforts to avoid were stopped.\n\nThe \"whole story\" is only important to me i suppose, and now even though it still bothers me i don't feel like typing it all out, but my statement above does cover the important part.\n\n\"Cut to the chase\"....I am in walmart's railinged-in \"shopping area\" and i want to get a cart. I walk towards the entrance where a woman employee happens to be standing, as i walk by her she quietly but directly asks \" Where are you going?\"\n\nI say \" i am going to get a shopping cart \"\n\n\" no, you can't do that, what you have to do is to walk around through the checkout lines, you don't have to buy anything, and get to the carts that way\"\n\nThe carts are very close to where she and i are standing, it is fucking obvious I am not trying to smuggle goods out of the store, the route she proposes i take has me walking quite a bit out of my way, she is being a cunt about \"the rules\" and i get very upset about this.\n\nI raise my voice to let her know i am upset and complain about the situation without threatening, or swearing. She counters quietly with \"I don't make the rules\"\n\nYes! like that somehow makes it better, this poor, poor woman was put in this position by her manager and she would love to help me but her hands are tied by ....\"the rules\" . most likely a fucking lie by a shitty little weasel who likes telling others what to do but has no real authority or guts to take responsibility for their own actions, a despicable trait i see in some.\n\nNow, when i said \" i am going to get a cart\" i know for a fucking fact there is a gate right where she is standing and she could have opened that gate for me and let me get a cart so i could shop, she chose not to do that and instead told me to essentially \"fuck off\" walk around dickhead! Although she did not reveal anything personal, the fact she didn't offer another solution to my problem is a very interesting point.\n\nokay, maybe, just maybe her boss told her to enforce \"the rules\" with NO exceptions, that is possible, but unlikely and she could easily see that i was not stealing anything, i believe she chose to apply \"the rules\" the way she did, it was \"personal\" in that she decided she didn't like me, and i am quite angry so i may be testing this theory on her if i ever see her again.\n\nNow, the thing that REALLY upsets me, that i have trouble letting go of, is.....i have personally seen many people walking out that very gate with a cart FULL of groceries and stealing the whole fucking thing...and you know what? NOT A SINGLE FUCKING STORE EMPLOYEE WAS AROUND! Nobody was watching them or chasing them out of the store, THE FUCKING THEIVES GET A FUCKING FREE RIDE and i as a law abiding, and good customer, get told that this safety measure we put in place to prevent theft that doesn't fucking work, well, at least we can use it to aggravate honest fucking people like you. I just cannot let this go, it is so fucking unfair.\n\nShe was right there, she could obviously see what i was doing........I think i see it now, this rant has helped, and my theory can be confirmed by a conversation with the next person i see standing there.\n\nAs i said this stupid gate doesn't prevent thieves from stealing and yet, some stupid employee is willing to made my day harder just to follow \"the rules\". I think perhaps she took a disliking to me instantly and when there was a chance to be nice to me she chose to be a cunt. For all of the people I meet in life that do this, i hope and pray that they are on the recieving end of exactly the same behavior and that they get to enjoy the same feelings i am now working through, i ask for karmic justice from the \"great magnet\" that controls the flow of all energies. This is my course rather than try to get direct revenge on them, this allows me to \"let god sort it out\" and let go and get on with more important things in my life.",

After a few months that developed into feelings. We started a talking stage. I had never been in a relationship and I found it hard to be with anyone in general but I liked him and gave it a chance. After a while, I started to realize that we were just not right for each other. I'm a person who is emotionally immature and has other issues due to my upbringing. I'm the oldest and was constantly fighting for a chance. Now how did it affect me? I kept trying to force change in me because I liked him. I had anger problems and knew very well. I tried my best to control myself but I just couldn't. We also tried to communicate my feelings and tried my best to understand him. Sometimes things were ok and others weren't. I tried to communicate how I felt about certain situations but I just couldn't get through to him. He wanted to change that only happens after months or years of therapy or help. I couldn't\n I tried so hard to not be the way that I am.\nOne day I exploded, like I knew I would. I was so angry at the fact that he never listens and that he always puts his needs before mine and I had enough. The actions following triggered me. He hurt me and I hurt him back.\nMy anger led me to choose words and things that I never thought I'd say. At the time I thought I was right to use those words at the time I was in so much pain and anger that I've been holding on. Now after some time I felt sad and apologized. I knew I did wrong and ever since it has kept me awake. I know that I did wrong so I apologize. We are nothing now but the way he looks at me is with such anger and discussion. He doesn't talk to me or notice I'm here, he just pretends I don't exist and goes on about his day. We spoke a few words and all I did was apologize although my anger at the time was justified my actions weren't. Now I want to know, am I a bad person? I always thought about this and I understand his pain. I made a mistake and I don't think that makes me a bad person but why do I feel like I am? Could I ever have a chance where he can forgive me? I love him dearly but I also can't ask a person to forgive me when I was in the wrong and I know maybe one day he could but what then?  ",

    "selftext": "Sorry, this is a long post, full of venting as well. And I'm also one of these people who needs to describe everything in details as I'm always afraid of people not getting the full context. But I guess writing in here will hopefully help me sharing my experience with like-minded people. For context I am male,39.\n\nI am not a violent person, I could never filter my anger on taking physical harm against someone else. I'm all peace. However, it does not mean I don't feel anger. I do, and whenever I start getting angry at someone I started boiling plans on how I can get back to them, revenge either by saying nasty words and humiliating them or trying to cause some damage somehow (embarrassing them in front of someone or compromising their job, whatever as long as it does not get back to me). This doesn't happen often, only when the person does me wrong.\n\nIn fact I'm a super nice guy in general. I go beyond and above my ways to help people and be kind to them. But I guess some people see that as a weakness and try to take advantage of you and that's when it makes me mad the most.\n\nSo this past month I'd say it has been crazy the amount of IDIOTS that contribute to the state I am now.\n\nIdiot #1 : this guy at work is absolutely worthless. Doesn't deliver at all and compromises the thing for the entire team. And seeing him trying to bs his way through it gives me second-hand embarrassment because he's so bad at lying. Well, he only gets me slightly annoyed with his incompetence but it's not the end of the world. In fact, it's even an advantage for me as since we have the same role in the company, he makes me look extremely competent and awesome by just doing the bare minimum lol. But yeah, working with someone so stupid, from time to time gets into you\n\nIdiot #2: we had a road trip a month ago. My boyfriend and me paid most of the stuff : gas, airbnb, groceries and we just agreed to share all the cost later between us, and the other 3 friends that went. One of those friends is a guy who studies with me at uni. He just recently moved into the country and because of that he does not have setup yet a bank account and the phone payment system everyone in here uses. I said it's no big deal. He can either paypal me or give in cash. He said \"I'll pay you this week\" . 2 weeks have been gone and not only no payment from him to me and my boyfriend but also just silence, not a word. I know he's not gonna scam me, he's from Japan...Japanese people are all about their honor lol. But then, what's up bro? Give me some news or something. I had to do the unpleasant task of reminding him about the payment. Apparently he also had issue with paypal to confirm his identity to do an international transfer and was too embarrassed to say something or whatever. But c'mon...be smart, dead silence is NOT the solution. It just makes everything weird\n\nIdiot #3: Another guy in my class, I am doing assignment with (the teacher selects the pairs). On a master's degree programme and this guy is absolute worthless too. Doesn't know basic stuff, doesn't know how to write a report. Then I spend more time trying to helping him catch up and that slows me down. So still, because I'm nice, I take my time to go meet him at uni, so we can sit together and I explain stuff to him. I don't have to do that, I have a full time job, together with a full time master degree, I'm hella busy. And then he's texting on his phone with his girlfriend while I'm sitting there doing stuff and explaining things to him? Man, I can do this shit with my eyes closed from home, but Im here wasting my time for you and you're involved in some drama with your greasy girlfriend that I couldn't care less? F\\*\\*\\* you (here, the anger is building up again)\n\nIdiot #4: planning a trip with my husband, I basically have to do all the planning otherwise he'll fuck up something...book wrong date of airbnb, forget some bus we need to book...whatever...and if I do ask him to take care of it, he'll confirm every little step of the way with me and ask a thousand questions (because he knows he'll fuck up). It's really annoying. But hey, he's my husband I loved him and I dedicate extra patience with him\n\nIdiot #5: Last month I booked a vet consultation for my recently adopted cat but during the day of the trip to the vet I had issues taking him there (he's still not trusting humans and don't let people grab him to put in the carrier) . So I asked the vet if they had a suggestion of in-house visitation to which they did and suggested me to call this other vet. So I did. I explained her the situation. Then she came all the way and she wasn't able to do shit because surprise surprise, the cat got super stressed around her and did not let her touch him. And she acted surprise on that and in the end couldn't proceed with the plan to collect samples from him. But charges us for the visit anyway. Are u stupid? The whole reason to call you was because we can't handle the cat so we would expect you had a plan for that. We managed with another clinic to get a proper consultation and luckily the cat was fine, but yeah...the wasted money on that in-home visit...\n\nIdiot #6: I saw a guy on a fb community. He comes from the same country as me and is struggling with money and was looking for anything, any kind of work that would give him some financial relief on his studies here. Since I have the means to help I thought about having him as our catsitter for when we are away for an upcoming trip.And I'd pay him much more than a catsitter would charge. So I messaged him about it. He agreed and was happy. Of course I'd want to meet him first, to get to know the person who'd take care of my cats. We went for a coffee, I explained the ins and outs of what to do and etc. Everything normal. This we were doing well in advance, about 4 weeks before my trip. I wanted him to come to my place to see some practical stuff and also get the key. His communication was slow but finally we manage to schedule for him to come on the weekend, 5 days prior to the trip. Dude got on the wrong bus , despite of me giving exact directions and bus number to my place (don't you know how to use maps?) . Arrived 40 min late which made me cancel another commitment. Once here, I explained everything, gave him the key. Everything seemed fine. Then next morning I get a message from him saying he wouldn't be able to help because apparently \"my place is too far\". How stupid are u? I gave u my address right in the first interaction and asked if this was okay. You said yes . I spent my time messaging you, discussing arrangements, waiting and explaining things for you when you were here at my place, which at that point he probably already decided to bail, but it is still wasting our time anyway. Now I'm fucked and have 4 days to find someone in a hurry. Not only , I have to probably skip one class or work hours during the week to get my key back from this idiot. This one really takes the cake and I really want to say something nasty to him when I meet him this week to get the key back. His nonchalant attitude towards all of it as if it's no big deal makes it even worse.\n\nSo yeah, this has been what my past weeks have been about. One idiot after the other, making my blood slowly boil and really making me wanna switch to interact with cats only rather than people. No more being the nice guy. No more helping people",

    "selftext": "Hey people so for a few years I fell into a deep depression and grew so mad at the world I've made 70 year old military veterans who got fucked by the government tell me to chill. Throughout that and the subsequent getting better (2020 start 2023 starting to improve). Throughout that I've dealt with a lot of people noticing I complain a lot. Also got about 30 times  my own family said things along the lines of.\n\n\"All you do is bitch.\" \n\nAnd variations thereupon in 11 months and it got to the point where my mom was physically on edge all the time with me and I became the reason no one comes over. Sadly even though I cared to get better. I was confused and obviously my family wasn't ok enough with me to educate me vs the casual and unhelpful.\n\n\"STOP BEING AN ASSHOLE/POS!\"\n\nSo here's a guide I made after researching for months with psychologists and personal experiences because I've been a lot of people's angriest person they've ever met. Hopefully it helps anyone.\n\nComplaining-To express dissatisfaction \n\nComplaining positives:\n•Relate to others \n•Being able to express oneself\n•Being able to see how bad your situation actually is\n•Relief of negative emotions (especially if understood/supported) \n\nComplaining negatives:\n•People dislike negativity and are apathetic \n•Can show you don't have a good grasp on your life\n•Can show you get overly mad about semi trivial issues\n•Can off put others if you act out of character as far as they know you or talk in ways that make them uncomfortable \n\nHow to tell you complain too much:\n\n•Negative conversations: You frequently have negative conversations or ruminate about past events. \n •Lack of solutions: You talk about problems without seeking solutions. \n •Negative outlook: You have a negative mood and outlook on life. \n •Physical symptoms: You experience headaches, fatigue, or muscle tension. \n •Relationships: Your loved ones may start to avoid you or seem distant. \n •Feedback: People mention how much you complain. \n •Communication: You have a negative theme in your text messages and emails. \n •Attention-seeking: You use complaining to seek attention and sympathy. \n •Pessimism: You may become a pessimist and decrease your appreciation for good things. \n •Helplessness: Talking about problems makes you feel helpless or hopeless. \n\nComplaining Vs expressing discontent:\n\nComplaining:\n•Puts blame on external things \n•Is very negative\n•Needs reassurance \n•Isn't solution based \n•Generally very uncomforting for others \n•Repetitive\n•Pushy\n•Doesn't accept others opinions \n\nExpressing discontent:\n•Puts blame on oneself (for feelings even if the thing is external) \n•Is generally not very negative (can be if it's bad) \n•Doesn't need assurance \n•Is solution based \n•Is rare and contained \n•Respectful of boundaries in discussing \n•Is open to others opinions \n\n“You/They/them” vs “I feel”:\nWith addressing others with you (and variations thereupon), it puts the blame on others which is usually not true as well as promotes defensiveness. Unless they are directly responsible AND you're mad to the point of ending that relationship (potentially) do not use accusatory terms. Using “I feel” shifts the responsibility onto oneself and lets the other person/party understand your outlook and emotions. Coming at people accusatory makes them focus more on defense vs actually talking it out. Coming at it honestly and semi vulnerable makes people generally want to show sympathy,listen, and talk it out. \n\nDisclaimer:Be sure to access the person is safe before engaging in this. In the event they were not safe try to understand the potential giveaways of the other person and accept your own responsibility on that. Also isn't the end all be all grain of salt this and combine it with other information to help yourself. \n \n",

    "title": "Does my horrifically short temper mean I am spoiled? (vent??)",
    "selftext": "TLDR AT THE END!  \nGrowing up, I lived in a very dysfunctional household. My dad was an angry, angry man, and my mum resorted to alch\\*h\\*l. This taught me enough in itself that my emotions were to be demonized. Anytime I expressed an emotion, it would circle back to \"anger\" and \"why are you angry?\" which became tiring. It just made me even more angry, if I'm honest. It gave me little patience, and since expressing how I felt ended badly, I closed up. With that combined with my slow realisation that my parents were very bad people, and treating me like this wasn't okay, it shortened my tolerance. I soon became a very short tempered, high fuse person. People described my anger to \"explode\" like volcanoes. This hurt me deeply, but since I didn't know how to safely manage my emotions, even sadness turned into anger. I resorted to \"If I'm angry, people will take my seriously. I need to yell to get my voice heard.\" This dynamic just sprouted into a stronger version of itself, and I began taking it out on things because I didn't know how to safely outwardly display my anger. I felt like telling somebody \"I feel angry for xyz\" wouldn't work, so I had to show them when I was angry, because that's the only way I was taken seriously as a child. Objects would be thrown, broken, smashed, I would cry for hours on end, fuelling my anger even worse. Half way through these \"outbursts\" I would feel an absolute wave of guilt and fear wash over me. I was wasting my time. I was wasting hours, days, maybe even weeks if added to a total, reacting like this. But I couldn't stop. Infact, that thought made me angry. Angry at the people who raised me this way. The only way for me to \"calm down\" was for me to eventually just stop myself. That being said, no outside event could stop me. Ever. Not even my own thoughts of \"just chillout dude\".\n\nFor a little more context, my parents would rarely take responsibility. They apologised yes, but often didn't mean it, and just repeated their behaviour. I grew up in the middle class. My mum made barely any money, but living with my dad as a teen, he made significantly more because he was a joiner who was self employed. He made enough money to buy gifts, or replace something pretty quickly. Of course, he didn't like spending money, he wasn't LOADED, but if he needed to buy a gift for someone, he would and could. This lead to stuff being bought for me as an \"apology\" for whatever awful thing he did. He also replaced stuff I broke, phone screens, keyboards ect. This absolutely did not help me take accountability. I thought this behaviour was normal. My patience grew thin, since I often didn't have to wait longer than 2ish weeks for something to be fixed, replaced or given. Due to my dad's popularity in his industry, he could get a LOT of what he wanted, just though connections. If we wanted or needed something that may have been harder to reach, he would \"pull some strings\" and it would usually go in our favour (our being me and my little brother). It would stretch beside wanting too, for example applying for college. When i applied to a college that may be harder to get into, my dad told me \"leave it to me.\" and within a few days I got emails from the school. Turns out he knew somebody who worked pretty high up at the school. This sort of weird demand definitely made my patience worse. I think about it often. I always felt guilty after breaking something (I only ever broke my own belongings) and ended up thinking that I broke things because I was spoiled. I'd imagine those tv characters who would throw a fit when something didn't go their way, and they would get it replaced almost immediately. It made me feel so gross about myself. Was I a spoiled brat?? This question hurt. A small part of me would tell myself that spoiled brats are given all they want, never taught \"no\" or patience, but that wasn't my case. I never expected stuff to be replaced, bought or gifted to me. It just happened, and as a hurting child I accepted. This is what i told myself\n\n  \nTLDR: grew up in what is bordering an ab\\*sive home, never taught patience, healthy expression etc. My family members always angry & aggressive, specifically my dad. Taught me anger was the only way to be heard and taken seriously. Bought gifts as apologies, thought that behaviour was normal. Replaced my own belongings when I broke them in anger. Skewed my patience skills and how to take accountability. Filled with guilt afterwards, every single time. Is this behaviour my fault or is it somebody elses fault for raising me this way?\n\nI'm growing older. And I am trying to work on myself, with the absolutely awful UK therapy system (The NHS is severely underfunded, therapy included.) but I seem to be getting nowhere. Reddit probably isn't the best place to look, but any closure is enough for me. I am growing tired and exhausted both physically, emotionally and mentally over these \"tantrums\", as my parents called them. So, I ask, given this much context so far, Am i spoiled? Will strangers view me as a brat? Do you view me as a \"trust fund baby\" and stuff along those lines? Or was i given the wrong end of the stick? Was i doomed the day i was born being born into this family? Is it my fault??",

    "selftext": "When I get angry, I cry. It’s not an option for me. I’m not sad, or hurt, I’m just seething mad, and the tears overflow. I HATE it when this happens, because I’m not just some whimpering cry baby that’s looking for sympathy or something, and that’s how I feel like I’m viewed when I start mad crying. I literally can’t help it though, and I don’t want anyone to even see me crying, it just happens. So when something happens, like at work or something, and I get really angry, the only way I can keep myself from crying is to just not say anything at all to anyone. I just go back to work, avoiding looking at anyone or saying anything, focus on keeping my breathing even and not letting the tears fall. Because the tears are there, just waiting. And I know I look like I’m walking around with an attitude giving everyone the cold shoulder, but the reality is that it’s taking every ounce of my self control not to burst into tears, and as long as I don’t speak to anyone I can keep from crying. The thing is though, it won’t go away until I actually have a moment to go somewhere alone and cry. So I’m just stuck like that, on the verge of tears, hands shaking, avoiding everyone. If I stay like this for very long, I’ll get a really bad headache. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? Am I emotionally unstable or something? How can I overcome the tears in the face of anger, and not have to completely shut down to keep from crying for no reason? \n\n",

My mom used to drink alcohol and would become violent (not toward me) and it confused me at the time. But I could tell she was angry with herself. My father left our family when I was 11 years old and it only made the meltdowns worse and I started to self-harm. I forgave my parents a long time ago and can understand how difficult ending generational trauma is. Now I’m 24 years old and am still in the same boat. I find myself hitting my head when I can’t handle this stress or anger. I don’t want to hurt myself anymore and I don’t want a specialist to think I’m suicidal. It just feels like I’ve been through so much and I have, but I want things to get better. I just get mixed up with the ‘how’ I can move past this. I’m extremely hard on myself and am a very emotional/empathetic person. It’s hard sometimes seeing myself after self harming because I feel so pathetic. I notice my mind will absorb the negative energy around me and it actually feels like I’m going through it. It’s frustrating because I know in my mind I cannot control others things outside of me or how people feel. I’m just tired of feeling so alone in this and realizing people have had this same way of coping helps. I try so hard with my coping skills,  positive affirmation, or what I’m thankful for that I learned in therapy which I do attend. But in the heat of moment it feels impossible. It’s so hard unlearning this unhealthy way of coping and thinking. My mind is trying to logically process this feeling and what I’ve already done to myself. There’s just no logic behind it, it’s just pure emotion and my inability to manage these overwhelming feelings. Sorry for the rant, I feel so lost and it’s hard to not be more ashamed or disappointed in myself when my head still hurts from hitting it. Please if anyone has felt this way, let me know how you manage this or getting through it. ",

When he's upset, he struggles to communicate and sometimes escalates quickly - he's thrown and broken things and even driven recklessly. While these have only happened a few times in our two years together, they make me nervous.\n\nI want to help him because I know he feels shame around his anger. Sometimes he admits it's an issue and shows openness, but other times he’s defensive, saying I’m overreacting. It seemed like he was more receptive at the beginning of our relationship, but now he insists he’s already “worked on it” and forbids me from offering suggestions. I understand that bringing it up adds to his shame, and I don’t want to amplify it, but my own fear often does that without me meaning to.\n\nI want to feel safe in this relationship and support him, but I also know there are limits to what I can handle. What are your thoughts based on your experiences: Can someone truly improve if they avoid taking full accountability? Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have advice on ways to approach this? How can I balance my support for him with protecting my own peace?",

It was being ok with it, sitting and listening to this difficult emotion. It was: as mentioned in the sidebar, JOURNALING, about it, specifically, analyzing it, looking into patterns, my own personal triggers, in order to understand that my Anger is actually unique, and so is yours. This means that even though certain techniques for dealing are the same and the emotional responses seem to be the same, the combination of the phases behind my anger cycle will be different to yours. Why? Because we grew up differently, we all have our own stories, our own childhood sensitivity. Even when you grew up with siblings or a twin, you won’t cope exactly the same. \nAnd one of the most surprising things I discovered was you want to befriend your Anger. If you have ever been to therapy, you may have heard that Anger is actually a secondary emotion, and the underlying emotions are what we are going to explore, if you manage to embrace and be ok with your anger, by feeling it, and consciously choosing the healthy coping mechanism. \nYou want to accept it, and have it become your ally, by telling you things about yourself like your own boundaries, your childhood wounds or trauma, your personal sensitivities or even lack of self care. \nI’ve put together a free series all about Anger, in hope to provide good info, actual analysis work, and real time techniques, everything on how I’ve done it. \nIt took me at least 6-8 months to stop reacting/coping in my unhealthy ways:  mine was yelling, screaming, and emotional outbursts. \nSending good luck to anyone who may be struggling with anger.

I was just wondering if I was the only one that ever felt this way toward someone? Because I have tried anti-anxiety medication. I have tried alcohol and pot, but nothing works. The only thing that brings me a little relief is crying which I hate doing and yard work, but I shouldn't have to go cut a tree down to get rid of all this anger. Anyone? Suggestions?",

    "selftext": "This has been something I’ve pretty much dealt with my whole life. I’ve always had anger issues, the slightest thing can set me off. It mostly happens when things don’t go the way I want them to, usually because of inconveniences, and a lot of times because of me. \n\nJust today there was an alcohol spill at my job, some person broke a wine bottle, and it was near the time of my shift where I start needing to focus on my closing responsibilities. I got so overwhelmed because I didn’t have enough time to take care of such a lengthy process *and* do my closing work, and my manager wasn’t able to help by doing one of my responsibilities, and I of course snapped from the pressure. I didn’t blow up at anyone specifically, but I did state to my coworkers rather bitterly that whoever knocked over the wine was “a fucking moron who somehow knocked over something on the hardest display to knock over anything on.” And punched the air quite a bit when I was alone to get rid of my frustration. \n\nThen after I take care of it, and put everything back, 10 minutes before closing the coworker behind the main counter asked if I could mop behind it because there were a few small sticky spots. I felt myself just give just a pained frown before agreeing, just to take everything back out. When filling the mop bucket I ended up having another burst of anger flow through me and I flailed the hose for a few seconds.\n\nAnd other times, when I’m at home and playing like a video game or something, when the slightest inconvenience happens (could be a dumb fail that costs me a few minutes, could be just me pressing the wrong key and dying as a result) I have to absolutely mentally restrain myself not to punch my wall. I feel myself heat up and I turn on my air conditioner. \n\nI embarrass myself. I feel like everyone can tell when I’m going through one of these periods and I feel bad about it. I genuinely don’t try to take my anger out on anyone (I don’t blame them for it) unless it’s something very specifically because of something someone did or said to me personally (and again, never violently), but it still sucks getting so worked up over the smallest inconveniences. I wish I could handle it better, and I wonder a lot if something is mentally wrong with me, or if I have some kind of disorder. Can anyone relate or maybe give some insight? I want to do better. I can’t do this anymore. ",

Sometimes he takes something from my best friend specifically just so he has to stop talking to me and go over and chase him. I swear he does it on purpose to get my best friend away from me (I swear I'm not crazy). I definitely think I'm getting angry from this. I feel territorial towards my best friend. We've known each other since the 1st grade and he's my brother. A lot of times I fantasize beating up my ex or just cussing him out to back off; which would be very uncharacteristic of me because I can't remember the last time I've actually yelled like that.

So who do we meet? Our ex-housekeeper with her four/five years old son (I don't remember how old he is and I couldn't care less.)\nWe talk a little and I ask him \"You know, I've known your mom since long before you were born\".

Well, white at first, then it went fully red.\nShe said she was sorry like a billion times and she told me \"Please don't mind what he said\".\nThat little piece of shit was lucky. He was lucky there were three adults near us (my father, his mother and the florist), he was lucky I'm overall a nice and polite person, he was lucky I was in utter shock, BUT MOST OF ALL, he was lucky we don't live in a mountain area. Spartan education would have fixed that lil guy.\nObviously our ex-housekeeper walked away like a minute after that happened\nI can't stop thinking about what happened.

    "selftext": "15M. Recently, when people tell me things that logically cannot get done as fast as they would like me to, or ask for me to do something while I’m already doing, it just takes the piss out of me and I always reply with something along the lines of “Idk chief, I’m already fucking doing it as fast as I can” or “Idk man I’m already fucking doing it idk what you’re asking for”. Amongst my friends when I reply like this, when they reply with “is it that time of the month again? 🩸💀”, which is clearly a joke, I don’t take it well, replying “Oh yea again with your shit fuck off and just shut the fuck up”.\n\nWhen I was 13-14, I started getting into self improvement and came across books that essentially taught me to be understanding of others and not lash out even if they do. And so a conversation between my friends and I when we’re playing game could go:\n\nFriend: “Are you deaf? Just fucking listen and do it”\nMe: “Sorry man Im trying, but please come on it’s tough to just apply exactly what you want immediately”\nFriend: “There’s no fucking need to ‘think’ just fucking do it”\n\nFor anyone who plays games, especially fortnite, you might be able to understand how someone asking you to do certain tasks isnt easy to execute especially when they demand for much without lots of specific instruction.\n\nSo I reply out of trying to be that understanding, “remember they could’ve had a bad day” guy. But after awhile, it feels like I take all this shit from them and I’m just disrespecting myself. So conversations slowly turned into:\n\nFriend: “Are you deaf? Just fucking listen and do it”\nMe: “Hmm idk man, how about you grow some fucking bollocks and give me some actual fucking clear instructions and what the fuck you’re expecting instead of saying one short fucking phrase and expecting me to play out like {insert pro gamer’s name}”\n\nBut somehow, that wasn’t enough, and it branched into:\n\nFriend 1: “Yo {friend’s name} and I are calling, can you join”\nMe: “Sorry I’m out”\nFriend 1: “Bruh” (simple expression of disappointment, no means to offend, right? but)\nMe: “Are you offering me a fucking solution?”\nFriend 1: “What”\nMe: “Exactly so don’t fucking ‘bruh’ me” \nFriend 2: “Is bro having a stroke”\nMe: “Shut the fuck up {friend 2}”\nFriend 1: “Is it that time of the months again” (Yes he’s referring to menstruation, and he commonly uses it whenever I’m angry. Regardless as to why I’m angry, whether it be simple irritation without provocation or a reply to something I’m offended by, he uses it. Of course, I’m sure he means it as a joke, but I’ve had enough)\nMe: “You too, shut the fuck up”\n\nFrom there, friend 1 and I moved it into private chat and it all blew out into a whole argument. In summary:\n\nFriend 1: “Why are you so mad when all I said is bruh”\nMe: “I would’ve expected ‘ok’ or just some old regular acknowledgement”\nMe: “If you said ‘bruh’ it can sound like literally almost anything I do is a disappointment”\nFriend 1: “Also as much as i dont want to say this but didnt you once tell me that the world is an unkind place and you cant expect it to conform to you?” (This wasnt a response, I’m guessing he’s trying to reference that to me reacting to ‘bruh’)\nFriend 1: “I say bruh all the time”\nFriend 1: “I am disappointed but so?”\nFriend 1: “If you don’t want to be treated like this maybe don’t throw tantrums about nothing”\nFriend 1: “If you have a problem with the word, tell me” (issue is: not like I haven’t tried to tell him. but it falls on deaf ears. either because it’s right after an argument or he simply didn’t take it seriously)\nFriend 1: “Don’t get hostile with {friend 2} and me”\nMe: “Well I apologise for that”\nMe: “But I want to add”\nMe: “If you don’t want me to throw tantrums about nothing then don’t treat me like this”\nFriend 1: “I apologise for name calling and it won’t happen again”\nFriend 1: “But I make no promises for if you throw a fit \nMe: “I apologise for being unnecessarily rude and hostile for nothing”\nMe: “But I too make no promises if you treat me unnecessarily off”\n\nAnd my does this still get my blood boiling everytime I read it:\n\nFriend 1: “You started it”\nFriend 1: “I don’t do it for no reason”\nMe: “Look man I shared what I feel”\nMe: “You have entitlement to what you want to feel too”\nFriend 1: “Yea you shared what you feel”\nFriend 1: “And I acknowledge it”\nFriend 1: “And I feel that you are being irrational” (really? like you aren’t?)\n\nI still can’t get over this knowing that he thinks he’s always right, and that if anything happens, he’s to blame me for it. But, I will admit that this is a guy who thinks very logically, and a good load of the time, he is right. \n\nI started watching Hell’s Kitchen, and I realise our conversations are a lot like those in the series, where he’s Gordon and I’m the whatever chef. I make my mistakes, and he points out the mistakes and is right about it, though in an unnecessarily rude manner, and I respond with hostility because I get I made a mistake, but what right have you got to treat me like shit?\n\nWell in summary, obviously to say it’s completely one or the other’s fault is complete disrespect toward myself or complete narcissism, and I don’t want to go to both ends. But I know the person’s actions that can change with the least resistance is mine, what advice do you have towards my easily triggered agitation while taking into account for the context?\n\n",

Ok she didn’t ask me to move she told the girl to sit in my seat but the new girl asked me if it was cool. I can be mean ik I ask her all the time to tell me if I said or did something to hurt her but I just feel like she doesn’t like me anymore that she just needed someone that could be with her when no one else was but now she has a bf that’s always with her she doesn’t need me.\n\n(Note I’m in high school I’m 16 so I might be over react but idk) \nIf you have any questions ask me I will do my best to answer and sorry about grammar I’m typing this up in class and I’m not allowed to have my phone so it was typed pretty fast 🙏any advice please \n",

    "selftext": "I am 23, and for as long as I can remember, I've had anger issues. However, the first started to get really bad in 3rd grade. For example, I would get a word wrong on a spelling bee, and would go into a rampage. There was one time I hit the teacher's desk and got suspended for a couple days because of it. During all this, I was taking a bunch of probiotics and enzymes for autism and doing hyperbaric oxygen therapy multiple times a week. This all stopped as this escalated. \n\nIn 5th grade, there was a student who would pick on me. I frequently got into outbursts because of this and I think he took my weakness to his advantage to get a reaction. One time I remember being in class and there was some reason I felt certain he took my headphones. Then at the end of class, he trips me and I get up and scream \"I hate you!\" and ran out the door. Usually I don't take my anger out on people, but he was one of the rare exceptions.\n\nIncidents similar to 3rd grade, albeit mostly on a more self destructive scale, occured throughout all of my schooling and even a few times in college. I remember once in high school banging my head with a calculator for getting a math problem wrong. \n\nI have also struggled with video games in similar ways. Say I die in a video game, I have a tendency to get mad. If I keep dying in Mario, I can have an outburst. Dying in Fortnite (what little I've played it) makes me hit tables. One game even made me punch a hole into a wall. I feel like I have to win and losing just gets to me way too easily. \n\nNow I am not in college due to a last rough semester over 2 years ago and feeling too nervous and indecisive to go bad. However, I now work 2 jobs and am stuck living with my parents. \n\nOne of my jobs is cleaning a grocery store. There have been a few times throughout my work history there that I have gotten uncontrollably angry, thankfully not in front of customers, but not appropriate regardless. One time I was emptying a trash can, and the bag ripped and was getting flour all over the floor. This caused me to have an immediate reaction to sling the bag around out of anger making a giant mess and cussing out the bag calling it worthless (these trash bags bust a lot). It made me feel like complete garbage and was awful to clean up. \n\nThen, just tonight, my family was making me to my little brother's math homework on IXL. I was doing fine apart from feeling tired and overwhelmed. However, as soon as I got an answer wrong, I immediately felt worthless and messed up the right click on my mouse and broke one of my large water bottles, all while screaming suggestive language and hitting all over my desk hurting my hands. Of course, I was yelled at for this and I felt like complete garbage. \n\nOverall, I feel like perfectionism is my biggest issue. I constantly feel on edge and as soon as something bad happens, anger hits me faster than I can begin to think rationally. My anger is thankfully mostly taken out on myself, but I hate having these outbursts at all and I just wish I could find a way to make them stop. They make me feel completely overwhelmed afterwards and feel like I cannot function because of them. After the fact, I can rationalize enough to realize that what I did was stupid, but it is too late. \n\nBasically, does anybody have any tips for stopping these instant boil overs when I have virtually no time to stop them?",

    "selftext": "I’m a very quiet, calm person. I rarely ever raise my voice and I’d never hit anyone or destroy someone else’s property. My friends of 10+ years have never seen me truly furious or even cry, only slight frustration. That’s not to say I don’t feel angry around people, but I’ve always been afraid to talk and to express my feelings in front of others. Because of this, the rare moments I am incredibly angry and by myself, I am destructive. I tend to break my own items, I’ve put holes in walls, and been tempted to take my anger out on myself. It’s a rare occurrence, but it’s a problem for myself when it happens. The thought of trying to just calm myself down and take things gently just makes me so much more angry. If I were to tell anyone about this, they may not even believe me or just think it’s some joke. It feels like I’m living some double life and I’m just an entirely different person. Keep in mind I’d never take my anger out on someone else, so I wouldn’t say it’s an immediate threat to anyone else but myself. \n\nEdit: Thinking deeper into this issue, I thought it’d be important to include the following information.\n\nThe only people that have seen me in that state of mind is close family (close family being my mom and brother). I isolate myself when faced with these extreme emotions not only because I don’t want to hurt my loved ones emotionally or physically, but because I feel ashamed of how I’m feeling. I constantly let the expectations of others dictate how I should act or feel, and when I experience these intense emotions I go into hiding due to the immense feeling of being a failure/disappointment to those around me. After my episode of anger/despair has concluded, I still isolate myself. I feel too awkward and ashamed to face my family once all is said and done.\n",

    "title": "Does dropping things make you angry? How to change your response to a better one! How to not be a rationally angry after dropping things!",
    "selftext": "\n\nI initially started this post as a response to another before it became far far too long of a post to be in the comment section. \n\nI for my entire life I've struggled with extreme explosive irrational anger after dropping things and only within the past year have I been able to make a change for the better I hope that this post can help other people with the same issue.\n\n...\n\nHey guys I've really been working on this the past year and while I'm not always able to just shrug off the experience in the moment it's been getting better and better to the point where now I don't think much of it. That is until recently when after moving back to somewhere I used to live I saw how much a loved one struggles with this on a regular basis and I relived how much I used to by seeing it. I'm hoping by sharing my own experiences with this I can help other people with this problem and also at some point hopefully help that person as well when they're in a place to hear advice on it.\n\nMuch of this is voice to text as I am also dyslexic and struggle with having to type everything out there will likely be some typos but I will do my best to keep them to a minimum\nAlso I am realizing this post is way longer than I meant for it to be and will put subcategories to make it easier to navigate 😩\n\nStep 1 finding the root cause:\n\nSo first off this and change for me really start with understanding the root of some of my issues with dropping things to begin with so while this can vary for different people I figure sharing my own logic for how I got to be so bad with this can help other people to self evaluate their own likely reasons for why they struggled with this. \n\nPart 1 Autism:\n\nPersonally I have recently learned that I am likely autistic and also have bad proprioception and I'm also prone to autism meltdowns. Due to my difficulty with motor skills I have been clumsy my entire life and therefore have been struggling with minor things like dropping stuff throughout the day my entire life this has led to me building and building a hatred towards these moments because it just seems to keep happening and is out of my control. \nOne thing that I have found helped a lot with this is allowing myself to have empathy for myself, recognizing that this is something inherent in my body that I struggle with and that wall I am very physically capable of many things I can struggle at times with motor skills and that that is something I have to accept. \n\nPart 2 childhood:\n\nAnother cause that I found for this or rather likely cause is the way in which people around me reacted to things being dropped while I was growing up and learning right and wrong from those around me\nThis first dawned on me when I saw a tiktok of a woman raising her kids and she had multiple videos of one of her kids spilling things and dropping things and her reaction to these moments were so intensely different from anything I remembered as a kid when I was a kid if I dropped something I remember people around me getting upset and I also remember witnessing other people in my life in my family dropping things and getting unreasonably angry and response as well so likely part of this behavior is from learning it from others and therefore repeating it myself as well as when I drop something getting annoyed because I knew other people would be upset or annoyed or mad because of that action. In the video this mother would show her kid drop something or spill something and her response was always oopsies or no response at all just uh oh you know just a little like oh okay that's that's no biggie and I literally started bawling my eyes out so if you haven't seen a video like that but you watch a video like that and you have a similar response that could be a root of it.\n\nStep 2 coping mechanism:\n\nOne of the interesting things about the human brain is that when you have a pathway form in your brain the more that pathway is utilized the stronger that pathway becomes. I personally love the visualization of imagining your brain as a deep dense forest at some point you walked from point a in the forest to point b in the forest to get from point a to point b you had to form a path maybe you slice through the path with machete maybe you slowly walked carefully winding through the woods maybe you found a field and walk through the field no matter what you made a path the more and more traveled the path became the more worn it was. So for instance if you have an action that is repeated over and over and over again that pathway May resemble a paved roadway or a black paved path through the woods versus a pathway that is only sometimes traveled maybe a dirt path maybe with some Vines growing across it and a pathway that is never traveled me just be dense brush. \n\nThat all to say the pathway from I dropped something to I get really mad is likely to be pretty damn paved at this point if you're an adult so the difficult part is trying to no longer walk that path so as to let the cracks start forming in the pavement trees to start growing through the path Vines to grow across and it all to go back to dense forest while at the same time walking New paths over and over and over again so as to form new ones that are easily accessible and eventually paved themselves. This visualization wallets a bit dramatic has been very helpful for me as a sort of meditation in these moments allowing me to visualize since I'm a very visual thinker and kinesthetic learner and therefore visualizing and then moving through this New path really helps me in these moments.\n\nSo that brings us to how in the heck do I start making a new path. \n\nPart 1 surrender/removal\n\nSo when it comes to surrender I put this into two categories one is the Fish flop and the other is deep breaths\nBut I first started doing the very first step that I started doing was anytime every time that I was at all capable of it when I dropped something my first step was always to fucking take a breath and it is so insanely simple but it does so much and it is so God damn hard when you are not used to it it's so easy to say oh you drop something deep breath before you do anything else yeah it's not that simple but the more that you can practice doing that the more that you will be able to improve it.\nSo every time moving forward that you drop something take a moment and take one deep breath maybe as you exhale that breath you sigh loudly and you just shake your shoulders right it sounds really stupid sounds really silly I know but it will help. Maybe one breath is not enough in some moments and taking five deep breaths will help right take as much time as you need you can even walk out of the room which falls more into the removal category right say for instance taking a deep breath while standing there looking at the mess that you just made by dropping something on the ground is too much for you take a deep breath as you walk out of the room you don't have to look at it anymore if you have bad object permanence like me you might even forget about it for a moment right. \n\nThe second concept the fish flop like to call it because I think it is funny sounding that way is really deep into the surrender category or if you think about it differently really deep into the removal category but more in the mental removal from the situation and this is in that moment when you drop something just laying or sitting on the ground. \nYou might feel really stupid doing it especially depending on where you are and who is around you and some cases it might not be right to do this move say for instance if you're in public it might not feel safe or socially acceptable to do but if you are in the comfort of your own home or if the breathing alone does not seem to help surrender into it oh you just dropped a spoon and now you have to go get another one sit down and breathe lay down and breathe and I mean full body deep breathing for just a couple moments. You can even do this wall also removing yourself in the situation right so you drop something in one room you take a deep breath as you walk out of the room and just flop onto the floor maybe the cozy carpet in the living room right or onto a cozy bed or a cozy couch and you just breathe.\n\nTaking a second to calm yourself before addressing the situation really helps\n\nI find specially because the pathway is so strong at the beginning that initial disruption is the hardest part but also can be the most simple step right so taking a deep breath removing yourself in the situation releasing the tension your body and just flopping to the floor surrendering into the moment gives you a break in the known pattern it is uninterrupted interrupts that initial gut stink reaction of anger rising.\n\nPart 2 healthy release of energy \n\nSo one of the next stages which I personally found I had to build to because it was very hard for me to do naturally is a healthy release of energy. Emotions are stored in the body if you hold emotions in they will come to harm you in some other way whether it is future emotional issues or physical sometimes even just tension health in certain muscle groups of the body due to not releasing your emotions correctly\n\nin these moments it is important to LOCATE the emotion FEEL the emotion RELEASE the emotion\n\nSo this category is focusing on that release of emotion in these moments you're likely feeling upset frustrated annoyed angry the unhealthy way of releasing that energy is throwing that little tantrum which is the known pathway finding a healthy release of that same emotion is going to be key in long-term ability to sustain this change \n\nOne of my personal favorite ways to handle this is with what I call \"Funny Anger\". I tend to be a bit of a cross and sarcastic person at times and in these moments especially I find that that is the next closest thing to anger that I can express but it is a little bit less bad for me so what I find really helped was after I had that deep breath being dramatically angry but in a way that was pushing comedy \nSo if I was going to give an example of this I'd say I dropped a spoon into the sink and hit a bowl of soapy but also grimy water that was sitting in the sink and it splashed on me onto the counter onto the surface around me and I'm annoyed cuz I dropped that spoon and I was washing the spoon and I'm pissed off now here's how I would Express that moment with funny anger. It would change each time slightly it wasn't some specific line that I would say or something though you could also do that like a mantra of sorts if that's easier but I would maybe I drop that spoon in instead of shouting truly angry I would go oh my God the world is ending oh it's horrible I dropped a spoon into the sink this is the worst thing that could have ever happened to me oh my God and I throw my hands up in the air and I would say it with this vibrato and this drama and maybe I can fall to the ground kneeling and then I'd like go oh my God and I just hold my head in my hands now that's absurd I wouldn't really do that around other people but if I was by myself I might do something along those lines.\n\nFinding some way to make that anger comical made it easier for me to accept those moments and when I would do this normally by the end of it it was so silly and dramatic that I would start laughing at myself because it was so absurd. And I personally have a dog who is sensitive to sounds and shouting and anger she gets very concerned if I'm upset so if I was alone meaning not with other people I was often with her so I would do these things more so at her goofily and she'd come over wiggling like saying what I'm doing and it would just be a funny moment instead of me shouting cuz I drop something in her looking terrifying I would be able to make it something that lifted my spirits. \n\nNow I understand that that method is not for everyone it wasn't even always for me sometimes I could not do then I just opted for a deep breath and then quietly angrily cleaning up the stuff but not shouting which was improvement enough so instead of that kind of release of energy you could also do a physical release of energy \n\nI find that anger can be very physical emotion it's very intense in my muscles and I can feel the way that anger tenses my muscles so movement is a great way to release that energy right that tightness in the muscles becomes something strong or flowy is the easiest way I can explain it \nAn example of a strong release would be say for instance you drop something you feel angry you start jogging in place and punching the air right but you're not shouting it's a different pathway it might not be the best pathway but you're starting to form different ones right the more different pathways you start forming the easier it is to break that initial one \nOr say for instance you need more of a flowy one and this one can also be kind of silly too if you play it that way you drop something and you just start breaking into dance or breaking into dance and song really go over the top with it and just find movement really truly any kind of movement you can take a lap around the house it does not matter any kind of movement could help in this situation to release that energy if you're in a situation where you can go for a quick run a quick bike ride a quick jumping on a trampoline I don't know jump rope something that could be your outlet try to find something that works for you as a release\n\nIt is important with a release of energy to get timing right so it release of energy should either be right before cleaning up the mess or right after cleaning up the mess so for instance if you dropped something that's glass and there's pets in your house it's not safe to leave the room and go for a run outside if those pets aren't confined to a different part of the house because it wouldn't be safe for them or right to do to them if they were to come in there and step on it so you might need to just take some deep breaths quietly clean up the mess and then go for a run or you could put your dog into a crate and then go for a run but ideally that release energy would take place before having to clean up that mess say for instance you just drop something nothing broke nothing is hazardous it's not important really that you clean up in that exact moment if there is even a mess to clean up in that moment go for that run go for that bike ride jog in place for a while until that is released you can even punch a pillow or a punching bag if you have it anything and then go clean up the mess when you're in higher spirits when you have those endorphins pumping through your veins\n\nPart 3 Inner child work, meditation, self love\n\nNow this category is kind of broad which I thought would make it longer than other ones but clearly I can talk for way longer than I thought about this 🫠\n\nInner child work could be a positive way to reform this pathway specifically if your childhood was filled with people reacting to these situations in an unhealthy way right reenacting the way in which that tiktoker that I described earlier reacted to her kids you drop something you go oopsies oh my goodness did you spill something and you can even say it in the kind of voice that you would use for a child or a dog treating yourself as if you are a child in your own home and healing those past moments in the process \n\nMeditation could be in that moment or in a future moment say for instance you dropped something in that moment you might take 5 minutes breathing meditating saying in mantra to yourself talking to yourself through it this is not that big of a deal it's only going to take me two seconds to really clean this up yes it's upsetting that it just happened and I wish that I wasn't so clumsy that I did these things but my hands and my body allow me to do so many wonderful things of course there's times that I'm not perfect of course there's times that I'm not able to not drop things especially given my difficult motor skill problems or specially given the fact that this bowl was slippery when I was washing it of course I dropped in it broke that's okay now let's just breathe through this moment and if you okay in this moment and accept myself in this moment. \n\nPart 4 Being around the right people \n\nNow one thing that I was lucky about is that I was able to do these changes in the setting that I was in I was around other people who did not have a hard time when they dropped things and I could watch the way that they were with those things I was around people who were not going to be upset with me at least most of the time depending on what I dropped potentially if it was something really important no one's perfect but overall if I drop something something broke anything like that they were the kind of people who would not overreact and negative way or be over the top about it and that allowed me to go through this transitional phase \n\nOne thing that would be important to think about and consider for yourself during this time of trying to rewire this pathway is how other people around you act and react now if they don't personally have the most healthy ways to react to things it can be very easy for those instances and witnessing those instances to rub off on you and make it harder for you to make a change \nmaybe if you are lucky they're the kind of people who would be receptive to also going through a change with you the hey I want to do this about myself will you be my buddy for it approach might work for some people but they also might not be and if that's the case thinking about a plan of how you're going to handle when they're having an overreaction or how you can separate yourself from them might be important \n\nOn the other side of the coin there are the people who will overreact at you if you are living with or spending an extended period of time with people who overreact because you drop something please understand that that is not a normal reaction if you drop something no one should be yelling at you no one should be shouting at you no which would be disappointedly shaking their head at you or cursing or anything like that that is not a healthy normal reaction even if it is what you are used to that does not make it normal or healthy \nFor some people you may be able to separate yourself from those people for other people you may not be able to find space or separation from those people I personally don't have much experience with this and can't speak on the issue much but it is something that you may want to think through and consider how you're going to handle those situations most likely if they're the kind of person who reacts in that way you cannot have a healthy constructive conversation with them about their future actions but maybe if there was someone who has issues with rage but is seeing a therapist or something like that there is a way in which you could talk them about it and best of luck to you if you are dealing with that\n\nPart 5 reflection \n\nNow this is more of a post reaction stage and it is that moment of self-reflection after a moment so say for instance you drop something you managed to take a deep breath you managed to calm yourself in some way and clean it up or mediate the situation well pausing and having a moment of self-reflection congratulating yourself on that it's very important \nTake a moment pat yourself on the back and tell yourself that you did a good job even if it feels silly even if makes you feel kind of stupid that moment can make a big difference in the long run because it's self rewarding that response making that pathway grow a little bit more because it felt good maybe you even had a reward system if you manage to drop something and then respond to it well you get a piece of candy you get a lollipop you get to buy something that's under $5 that you really wanted but you were just not buying right then maybe you got to go get yourself a coffee something enjoyable maybe you get to watch 5 minute video of something funny right something to reward yourself for that reaction \n\nnow on the other side of that say for instance you had a moment where you had this over the top dramatic reaction you were too tired that day too hungry that day too exhausted for some reason you were not able to do your best in that situation or maybe it wasn't necessarily a bad day but you're just still early on in the process and it's really hard to change your brain so you blundered a little bit and you did a bad job at your reaction and you feel embarrassed you feel upset you feel silly especially say someone else saw you with that reaction and now you feel foolish \nIn that moment having a little meditative self-reflection or maybe sometime a while after the moment when you've calmed down enough reflect on the moment look at ways that you could have gone about it differently maybe you could have done something different before you even drop the thing to get yourself in the right headspace say for instance you were running around frantic in a rush and that's why you dropped something maybe you need to start thinking of ways that you can change that frantic energy that you're having before you even dropped the items maybe you need to start being able to recognize those moments, sometimes it's hard recognize those moments before the issue happens but afterwards you should be able to self reflect to a certain extent and even if the next time you do the same thing the next time you do the same thing and the next time you do the same thing eventually if you keep on self-refing on those moments and in your head thinking I get to frantic and then I drop things I get too anxious and then I drop things I don't eat enough breakfast I don't give myself enough fuel I don't get hydrated enough I don't get enough sleep and then I do this and then I get too upset and I can't handle it recognizing those issues and starting to do little microscopic changes will eventually start diminishing the number of instances and the intensity that you're feeling and having in those instances \n\nAnother thing to consider it in these self-reflective moments is self compassion not just how could I've done some things differently but telling yourself it's okay that you're still learning we are all here for the first time in our memory we don't have another life of experiences that we can access we don't know everything there is to know in life we don't know how to handle everything it's okay to not do the right thing the first time even the second time if it's new to you it's hard to do and growing your own self compassion more and more will make the whole process of changing easier\n\nStage 3 practice \n\nLastly I know that this somehow ended up being its own book but if you got away here likely you're very committed to making this change like I was and I want you to know that it is doable it is a pain in the ass but it is doable and sadly it's going to take long time so practice everyday practice every time it happens practice every moment you're able it might be hard at times there might be some days where you don't have the capacity to deal with any of it and just fall into the old patterns and that's okay but the next day is a new day you wake up and you practice again getting yourself in the right mindset and having the goal to practice this everyday so that you can slowly make this change will be key \n\nI'm sorry for the Post being so insanely long but I do hope it genuinely helps someone out there I hope other people can share their experiences and I hope to hear from people who either have already made that change or are working on it as well \n\nAnd with much love best of luck 🥰",

    "title": "My Autistic Anger Management Journey - Strategies And Thoughts ",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone! About a couple months ago, I posted on here about my experience living with autistic rage meltdowns. Since then, I've been working hard to manage my emotional responses and have made more progress than I feel I've ever had before, I wanted to come on here and talk about the recent developments to see if it would be helpful to others or get outside input.\n\n  \nThe main strategy I've used is a 0-5 number scale to monitor anger/stress levels in my day to day. I used to find number scales in mental health arbitrary and confusing when applied to depression, anxiety, etc. but when I began thinking of it as depicting a level of risk I was at having a meltdown, I saw a lot more utility in the practice. The current approximate scale I use goes like this -\n\n0: No risk of agitation whatsoever, EXTREMELY rare. I've got to be half-asleep or sedated or something.\n\n1: The mildest of agitators at play. \n\n2: Starting to get into more legitimate frustration and impatience, but not to the point of serious anger. \n\n3: Anger to the point where you feel you have a serious problem to solve (or put great effort to weight out), but can still keep a level head. \n\n4: More intense irritability, people in my immediate space should be warned I'm in a more unstable state as a majority of my energy is focused on keeping myself calm.\n\n5: On the verge of a meltdown, can still be avoided with enough effort but i should definitely brace myself to go outside somewhere secluded to just scream it out, especially if the 4-5 state has been hit multiple times in a row. \n\n  \nthe numbers don't have to be exact to describe any state you're in at any given time, but the important and helpful part has been a quick and easy framework to remain aware of myself and what mental state i'm dealing with - being able to quickly identify \"oh i'm at a 3/4/5\" has made it a lot easier to keep myself in check and develop heightened awareness of my anger levels. It's also helpful because it lets me know when to warn others around me of my mental state - I think a lot of the fear that can be caused by even non-destructive angry outbursts is that, from the outsider's point of view, they often times appear to go from 0-5 instantly, when that's rarely whats actually going on inside the person's head.\n\n  \ni've also began keeping track of days since my outbursts. It has been 47 days since the last outburst I had that was witnessed by and emotionally harmed another person in my life. (I've never been physically violent with anyone and don't have a tendency of verbally lashing out, but I did say some pretty nasty things in this incident specifically). Since I've instated this system, the longest I have gone without an outburst in general has been 30 days - not an unheard of number for me, but certainly the longest I've gone since at least the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, that streak ended today as I have had a rough night coping with a recent break-up, and hit the point where I knew I had to just go to a secluded parking lot and scream it out. \n\n  \nI eventually want to hit a point where I can say these intense meltdowns are behind me for good, but I want to know if that is even a reasonable expectation to have for myself? I have been meaning to get back into therapy but unfortunately its never been amazingly helpful for this specific issue. I am very grateful for the understanding and forgiving people I have in my life who have stuck by me in spite of my issues, but still deeply mournful of the friendships I have lost because of this side of myself, and only want to be a safe presence to others.  \n\nSorry for the long-winded post! Hope this reaches someone who understands. Much love.   \n",

To put it simple, my anger and hate are buried for the most part under a huge pile of shame and guilt, that they made me feel as secondary emotions and they became so powerful that they hide the original anger and hate. This is because I feel my anger and hate as immoral so in my mind they are dangerous, evil and illegitimate because in the past when I showed anger and hate they led to punishment and rejection. So obviously I have a trauma story, complex trauma more specifically. I have huge issues dealing with these two emotions, in fact, they made me feel so much shame and guilt that I become paranoid fearing to be attacked at any given point, they really are triggering for me.

I told my husband that we cannot deal with his anger issues anymore and I wanted to separate (husband has a long history of ‘meltdowns’ - losing it over something minor, screaming/ranting/swearing at us, storming off and then silent treatment until he feels better then acts like nothing happened and expects us to do the same). This is the second time recently our son has taken off after his dad blew up at him, last time it was winter, son was on foot and didn’t have shoes, a jumper or his phone so I had no way of contacting him. \n\nHusband denied his anger issues, has conveniently forgotten all the times his anger has gone too far (no physical abuse but he has thrown clothes in anger twice) and started blaming me and the kids. He said I’m withdrawn and shutdown to him. Yes I am, because I can’t deal with his anger anymore and I can’t talk to him about it without him blaming me or the kids or the dogs for his behaviour. His last meltdown ruined my birthday and he thinks that buying me flowers and an expensive cake,  but not actually apologising, made up for it. \n\nHis anger has pretty much ruined his relationship with one child and now it looks like the same is happening with his brother. Yet husband still believes he’s the one hard done by. In his words, ‘nothing I do will ever be good enough for this family!’\n\nI’m not really looking for advice, as I know this environment is too toxic and unhealthy for me and my children and I am taking steps to fix that.

I’m not always aware that what I’m saying is hurting their feelings when I esteem that if they said it to me my feelings would not be hurt. \n\nAnyways.\nMy sister and I were born a year apart so that makes us almost the same age. We have a complex relationship, not only because of that but because of the differences in our personalities; she’s kinder and softer than me and I admit that I lack some empathy towards her. I also am aware that my personality can sometime steal the spotlight and not in a good way because I’m always the one arguing and being loud.\n\nA situation happened today where she was wearing something of mine that i cherish very much, and when I saw it I said it in front of everyone in our friend group and we started arguing as I admit I did attack her. And then it turned into our habitual « me-being-arrogant-about-it » and her « being-defensive-and-saying-she-hates-me ». I’m guessing the part where she says she hates me is coming from the built up resentment. Earlier tonight I tried explaining and saying I’m sorry as I felt really bad about kind of saying in front of everyone, but she only attacked me and kept saying she hated me (again). She also tried to give me a lesson which just made me laugh because I don’t esteem she’s in the position to give me a lesson. So we only circled back to the me being arrogant and her saying she hates me and believing she has done no wrong towards me. \n\nThat being said, I wrote this knowing more and more as I typed what I should do about my relationship with her but I can’t seem to get over myself and show kindness to her. I may be toxic and a bad big sister but I feel like there are so much things I want to address and explain but I’ll just seem like I’m trying to attack and argue again. \n\nAnything to say, constructive advice ??",

    "title": "6yo son’s anger triggers my anger",
    "selftext": "My son is highly intelligent and a truly good-hearted boy. He has struggled with explosive anger since he was around 3. We hoped it was a typical age 3 phase, but it did not pass. He has a lot of empathy in calm moments and doesn’t seem overstimulated by lights or loud sounds, so it doesn’t strike me as ASD related. Triggers are not getting his way, losing a game, or something generally not going as he envisions it “should”. Early on, I attempted the “gentle parenting”, emotional validation, sit quietly until the anger passes approach, but emotional validation seemed to pour gasoline on the fire, and many times he became physically violent with me, and me trying to stop him enraged him more. Nothing felt like it worked in any way. I often wanted to scream back at him and on rare occasions, I did. Most commonly, the situation would escalate to a point where I would feel my anger start to escalate, so I would tell him- “Mommy is MAD and needs a break.” He would follow me banging on the door and screaming while I cried silently on the other side, sometimes with  his younger sister with me. Whether I kept my cool and “took it” or screamed back to the point that it scared him into submission (I didn’t do this often, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t happen; my husband also did this on occasion), it all felt awful. He was in therapy, I was in therapy. We talked extensively when he was calm about how anger is OK, but hitting, screaming, and name-calling is not. We talked and modeled strategies. We discussed how anger feels in our body and it’s best to take a break earlier rather than later. He grasped all of this during calm times, but it just went out the window once he got angry. It just felt like life was a daily roller coaster. I honestly didn’t realize quite how divergent his behavior was until my mom and sister both commented on “how patient” I was. (I would never previously have described myself as patient, but they were commenting on how many times per day I had to keep it together while being screamed at.) Also being around similarly aged kids during “bad tantrums” and realizing we were on a totally different level. That realization led me to decide I needed a different tactic. I told him, from now on- you get a warning, but after a warning, if you scream, hit, or name call, you will immediately go to your room until you are able to be calm enough to treat people with respect. It doesn’t seem that me being with you is helpful, so you are going to need to work on it on your own and come out when you are ready. I enforced it to a T. I actually had to lock him in/out of rooms the first few days. It made a huge difference, not just in his behavior, but in my anxiety, because I didn’t have to suddenly wonder whether I could keep my cool with him screaming in my face and trying to hit me. I had a plan. We are now one year later and we’ve seen enough shift in behavior and occasional ability to “talk through it” that we’re now attempting to “gentle parent” more, rather than having those rigid boundaries, but it seems to be happening more frequently again. My husband and I really don’t yell at him anymore, but I feel angry and just general negativity toward him/anxiety about how he’s going to act, which I know perpetuates the cycle. We sat down with him last weekend while calm and had him pick 5 different things he could do when starting to feel angry, and if he did one, he got a sticker. Daily, multiple times a day, we’ve encouraged him to pick something from the list so he could get a sticker. Almost without fail, he refuses to acknowledge he is angry. This happens even at the frustration phase, well before he is “seeing red”. It’s almost like he’s ashamed of it, even though we’ve had so many talks about how everyone feels angry sometimes, and that’s OK. He takes it out on his 3yo sister often, which is maybe a different issue. We had a rough evening tonight with multiple outbursts triggered by: he had to pause a game of chess to play dinner, I didn’t play football according to his very specific rules; when I brought his bike out to him, it wasn’t in the exact right place, I wanted to play catch instead of “real baseball” (bc “real baseball” usually ends with me being screamed at). Me needing a break is also a trigger, so I feel like I’m in a lose/lose situation when I feel my patience rapidly degrading. We discuss having appropriate expectations before things that can be triggers, mostly games/competition. Sometimes it helps; sometimes it doesnt. Tonight, after I said I did t want to play the kind of baseball he wanted to, he came at me aggressively with the bat. I don’t think he would’ve hit me, but that made me scared, then mad, and I grabbed him pretty forcefully and took him into the house. He came out a few minutes later, seemingly better, but was a roller coaster from then on. \n\nI read other Reddit posts where parents seem distraught that they had one single incident like ones I’ve described and are distraught by their kids behavior or their reaction. But we go through spells where this is daily life.\n\nI am trying to work on my own anger, bc I know I am more easily triggered than others, but even my therapist doesn’t have much advice on this. I feel like I have practically begged her, as well as other parents for advice on anger management from all angles. It’s just like, “yeah- parenting is so hard. Mom rage is real.” Validation is helpful at times, but I need advice. \n\nPlease no personal attacks, but I am OK with hard truths and very specific recommendations.",

    "selftext": "When I was younger, I witnessed a disturbing event between my parents: my father once pulled a knife on my mother during an argument. Initially, I tried to intervene, but I became so emotionally detached and indifferent that I ended up not getting involved at all. I think about it sometimes and feel conflicted, especially when I contemplate how difficult life would be for me if my mother were to die. These thoughts often lead to feelings of regret, yet I find myself reverting back to indifference.\n\nThere was also an incident where my mother was harassed on a bus. Although there was no physical contact—just a drunken man staring at her—she became very upset and started yelling. I didn't intervene; I just stood there. Afterward, she asked me why I didn’t defend her, and while I felt guilty, our relationship has been complicated. At times, we got along well, but these incidents often linger in my mind.\n\nI wonder if I use these experiences as an excuse for my behavior. Since childhood, I have been subjected to physical punishment and verbal abuse from both my mother and father. Because of this background, I struggle to protect myself and others, including my loved ones. For instance, when my brother is mistreated, I find that I’m indifferent or apathetic. Even if someone is being mean to him, I don’t care, and this might be because he has treated me poorly in the past.\n\nSometimes I think, \"Why should I care?\" even if someone is behaving kindly. I fear that intervening might lead to more conflict, and this fear often paralyzes me. When someone mistreats me, I don’t respond by standing up for myself; instead, I take my frustrations out on those who are weaker or more vulnerable.\n\nThis cycle of fear and detachment reflects a deeper issue within me, where I feel like a coward. I have a tendency to withdraw emotionally, leading me to feel like I’m failing to protect not just myself, but also those around me. I often want to express these feelings and unpack them, but I find it difficult to articulate the complexities of my emotions.\n\nI feel trapped in a loop where my past experiences shape my current actions and reactions. I realize that my childhood, filled with conflict and fear, has left a mark on my psyche, making it hard for me to respond to challenges in a healthy way. I want to break free from this cycle and learn to advocate for myself and others, but I struggle to find a way to do so.",

Guilt, depression, and anxiety mostly.

(I was aggressively verbal and loud) and Two: I live with my some family. (They were shook and slightly resentful) \n\nIt’s been this way since junior year of highschool (20y old now) since a lot of jurassic changes happened within my life during the pandemic. In my fits of rage I dive deep into philosophical issues, I blame other things rather than myself, and I get quite violent thoughts that I really feel ashamed of.\n\nI been in therapy since 3rd grade to 10th grade of HS and been out of therapy for about three years. Since the the last visit of my therapy I started journaling and using therapeutic methods to heal and recover from high stress events but here is where I get to the “loop”. \n\nAs time passed out of therapy, I’ve suffered some more adult problems like having to quit my first job, pay bills, and buy then sell a car. Sure I had better times but then I moved through life with more caution of myself and my reactions to things and that’s were I would lose control. Some things I took offense to or felt attacked at for small things. Yet with that caution, anxiety started rising before any task at hand or even social events and other things. Then when something breaks that anxiety it shifts into a fit of sourness and when I’m alone or simply in a room by myself I get even more flustered. It starts with angry ramblings then to my fists pressed on a wall or counter, I get into dark thought patterns and boom. I get verbal and would bang my palm or fist on something.\n\nThis “loop” will happen many times and I tend to “crash” during the come-down because I don’t want this to affect me further in life. I hate this version of me and I just feel so guilty and ugly when it happens. When I come down I just become closed off too who I affected and even sometimes cry to sleep. Then when I recover or get my enthusiasm for life back, I get that anxiety all over again. Do you guys get this anxiety to anger loop? Or do I just need to get back into therapy?

My husband tells me I just need to catch myself before it happens, but I literally feel like I can't. My mom says it's normal and I need to learn to take breaks, see if someone can watch my child for me occasionally so I can have a break (I work part time from home with my child).

She has two children from a previous marriage, and my father had three - my two brother’s and I. \n\nMy father just recently passed away on September 1st, 2024. Two weeks after his passing, my youngest step sister and her husband already have their house up for sale and are moving in with their mother (the house my father and their mother shared). This is something my step mother told my bother was happening a week & a half after our dad’s passing, but just yesterday (9/22) I heard it from her own mouth. Which explains why she has been in a rush to move all of my father’s belongings out of the house. \n\nI did have a conversation with my step mom about how it hurt my feelings - just seems like everything has been very rushed. She claims she can’t afford the house by herself, yet also told my brother she’ll be receiving enough from our father’s life insurance policy to pay off the house. \n\nI just wanted some opinions here really. To me, it looks like once again her own children are benefiting. Benefiting off of my father’s death this time, which really pisses me off. I had a conversation with my step mother yesterday while moving my father’s things out of the house, and she said my step sister is planning to buy the house once my step mother retires and moves back home to Kansas to be with her sisters. I’m just wondering why me or my brother’s weren’t offered to buy the house. \n\nI’m really not trying to make this about money. According to my step mom, my father only had a living will. Nothing else. It’s just really hard to believe my father would leave us with absolutely nothing, but I can believe she had him brainwashed. She’s always been controlling over finances. I remember quite a few times when I was young, still living at home.. I needed help buying college books and my father helped but she made me pay him back. It’s just little things like that, that have always rubbed me the wrong way about her. \n\nMy siblings and I had felt very left out of everything during his sickness. But feeling very left out now, and no clue as to what’s going on. We have inquired about my father’s truck (already paid off) because we don’t want to see it go to a stranger, and she point blank said to us, “do you have 30k?” She split up a few of his belongings to each of us, but I feel like that was just to cover up her own greed and for her to feel good about herself. \n\nI just really feel like her & her kid are benefiting off of my father’s death. It’s hard not to make it about money, but everybody is struggling and it just seems like my step mom has been very sneaky. She always has been, but especially now. The way she’s making moves so quick doesn’t look good to me. \n\nI sure do miss my dad.",

A perfect example is this small dog my mom has, I can’t stand him, sure hes cute but his happiness and big dog act always piss me off and I don’t know why, I have a bipolar relationship with this dog and its making me crazy and I don’t want that, the dogs hyper act towards other people just makes me feel embarrassed; especially when my mom feels the need to bring him everywhere she goes. People get so adored by him it annoys me, hes the type of little dog to piss and shit all over the house and he has a soft spot for my room to where i had to resort to closing the door. He is usually always in peoples way and never stops bothering people when theyre eating. He is afraid of me because of how rough I get with him, when hes being annoying like when I am forced to walk him something inside me just wants to yank him hard on the leash. I don’t understand why this dog makes me mad but he does. My mom always tells him “go with your brother” which is pointed to me and it makes me so annoyed, I feel like I should just stay away from the little bastard, I got in trouble today because theres this specific room that I don’t want him in, because he just gets in the way, and bad things happened and I got yelled at. I might have a crazy anger towards this little dog, please leave some advice and I hope maybe some people can share their similar story, I don’t want this to let me go down on my dreams and as a person entirely over a little dog",

My day was completely fine and then it was like I was a whole different person. I started screaming and hitting stuff and hiding things I locked myself in the bathroom and cried loudly. At one point I was called psychotic by my mother and she left the house. I grabbed a marker and wrote psychotic everywhere and according to my sibling she called me insane and I wrote that too? It's a bit cloudy. I just know I broke stuff and wrote any bad name I was called all over the walls and I was just acting like I had all the power in the world it's like I had a ton of energy but also anger. Something happened recently and it wasn't as bad but I started yelling and didn't feel like me again. I didn't brake anything or write anything this time and it was shorter as my last \"freakout\" was like a bit more then a day. This one was only a few hours but it feels like it keeps coming back slowly before it goes big again. I think maybe it's an episode of some sorts. I was wondering if it could be a sign of anything and it could help me tell my therapist what I think I may have and I just want opinions from people to see if it sounds familiar I'm going around like a few servers. I can't tell if it's anger problems or something different.\n\nThank you",

    "selftext": "I'm totally fine like literally a millisecond before I snap. There's no way for me to see it is coming. I don't notice the stress and emotions piling up until after I have snapped.\n\nI am a happy person 99% of the day. Like annoyingly happy and optimistic and in a fun mood. Then out of nowhere, something triggers me and I snap so quickly that I don't have time to decide to \"take a breath\" or \"walk away\" or \"think about how to handle this.\"\n\nI always snap at my partner. I don't snap at friends, family, or strangers.\n\nI don't want to snap, ever. I hate myself for it. I would do anything to change it.\n\nI know he can see that it's coming even though I cannot. But instead of him saying \"hey babe, you seem overwhelmed and over stimulated\" he sees it and lets it build and sometimes decides its a good time to add something on top of it. Sometimes I feel like he wants me to snap so that then he can say \"look, see, you are a bad person\"\n\nI have fought depression and anxiety in the past and I overcame both of them because there were tools and tactics I was able to implement. But how can I use anger management tools when I don't even know the snapping point is coming?\n\nI do everything for our relationship. I manage all of the cleaning, house administration for our houses and our rental properties, paying our bills, taking care of the dog, I work very long hours with my job (I work from home for a company), but I work a lot of overtime, like 12 hours per day many days, and I get very easily stressed out. He often has depression and a just works a part time job (he still makes more money than me though so money isn't the problem) but the rest of the day just sits around and watches movies. He is usually watching movies or youtube 6-11 hours every day. He never stops looking at his screen. If I am lucky, I find the time to watch maybe one movie a month?\n\nThis week I worked four 12 hour days in a row. I wake up and walk the dog then start working immediately. I literally have my laptop out working until the moment I close it and fall asleep. (I take some breaks through the day to walk the dog, clean, grocery shop or work out, but I'm usually still working until 1am). And yesterday I was really stressed with work and everything else I have to do for our personal lives and the dog was crying because it needed to go out. And he was just sitting there watching movies while I had already taken the dog out 5 times today, I thought, can't he just take the dog out once? He is just watching the movie with the dog crying in the background. Can't he see that I'm in the middle of working and he's just watching his 3rd movie of the day?? The dog crying is very triggering for me so I snapped.\n\nI instantly raised my voice and said \"you're so lazy! you don't fucking help me with anything!!! I'm fucking drowning here while you're watching your third movie of the day!!!\" It turned into a 3 minute rant of me cry yelling and explaining how he literally doesn't do anything to help with anything and that I feel like I am carrying the weight of everything and I physically cannot do it anymore. And he just always sits there in silents when I do this. \n\nHe never takes anything off my plate or even tries to help me whatsoever. I love him so much and he's my best friend but I feel overwhelmed because it always falls on the woman to do everything but now we are expected to work full time jobs too.  His lack of contributing is because he has depression. I try to just back off and give him space when he's having depressive episodes but it infuriates me to carry all of the weight of our lives and our relationship and never receive an ounce of help or support from him. And it infuriates me to be working so hard and never having a moment to myself while he is just laying in bed all day watching movies.\n\nI just wish I could see that I'm going to snap before it happens so I have time to choose to react differently. Because now he will punish me for days for having that reaction. He will make me feel like I am the worst person in the world because I snapped. He won't talk or hang out with me and will make me feel like he's going to leave me.",

Everything she says is poison. She treats my whole family like shit and expects free hand out at her big age. She lives for free, asks my mom to instacart her  soap, and charges me for every pump of shampoo I use. She is a bitch. A loser. She does body building and that makes me think she’s even more of a loser. \n\nI can’t live like this. We have a family of 4 and my value is being on good terms with everyone. My whole life she was a problem (like with police and parents) and now, she’s 25 and the most insufferable person I’ve ever seen my life. She is struggling but she is ungrateful and rude. She diagnoses people with disorders and judges everyone and tells me things like I’ll never go anywhere in life (because I wasn’t working, but I’m in college unlike her). She doesn’t help me with anything at all. I can’t count on her if I was dying or unsafe. She makes me walk alone at night because she wouldn’t drive 3 minutes to get me. If she does something for me, it has a cost, and one that’s ridiculous. For example, if I wanna use her car to grab a coffee down the street, I have the fill the entire gas tank. She can leave a dish in the sink, but if I do, I am the world’s dirtiest person and lost for a wife.\n\nAnyways. I hate her so much now. Like to my core. She scares me and is a violent person. I am physically not intimidating at all, she always makes threats like “I’ll get what’s coming for me” and “you’ll see”. My sister makes me feel like I need a gun license. I don’t feel safe around her. She’s also a thief, so I can’t even leave my room unlocked (yes, I changed the lock to a key one because I have no trust in her). \n\nHave you ever met someone so cognitively incompetent that you think they are doomed beyond a cure? That’s my sister. I do think she’s missing critical thinking skills and brain cells. She is so jealous of me and I hate it because she makes me cry and makes my life so hard. I work with no car, I have had to Uber ever day to and from work because she hates me. She wouldn’t take me to get my prescriptions either, so now I’ve gone 4 days without my medicine. I honestly really just want to scream at her and tell her what a loser she is but I’d feel bad so I don’t do that. I just shake with anger alone and cry ready to hurt myself or something because she makes me feel so much pain. Where is my sister? She wouldn’t even consider me family. She doesn’t talk to my dad (5 years), is rude as shit to my mom who gave her a home, and she is disconnected from my life. I know she won’t be at my graduation, she’ll be too busy scaling out how much protein to eat that day.  ",

I was surprised, because I'm a pretty chill person, when I'm among people and I'm angry I'm usually quiet about it. But I've been thinking and yes, I'm very angry. My sister provokes me to be angry like years ago and does other stuff that make me angry like being disrespectful to our parents that are trying to do their absolute best for our happiness (I'm almost 18 now and she's two years older) and I'm mad at her, but I don't have a way to relise the anger.\n\nMy therapist adviced me to go and destroy some stuff, of course in a safe way. She said it's good to trow icecubes at trees and that's what she does, but I don't think that's for me. I went for my usual walk one day and took some long sticks. I started hitting a laying tree with it, I think I completely broke like 20. It helped, but just a little bit. I know I'd have to do a lot more to feel the actual relief I need. And now that I started to act on the anger it wants to get more attention.\n\nSo I've been thinking about other ways. In some time it will take me a lot of time to find enough sticks, so it's not an ideal way. I thought about taking an axe with me and destroying the trees that had fallen down. That's of course not ideal, it would be difficult to take an axe with me. I could also find a good stick and hit glass bottles that are lying there, but that's probably not good for the forest (I'd get safety glasses so I don't harm myself).\n\nI've also got a wooden baseball bat, but I'm not sure what I could do with it. My therapist said that hitting a fighting bad or something wouldn't really help, because the thing needs to be destroyed as I hit it.\n\nAny advice? The best place for anything like that is a forest, I know places where I could hide stuff so it could stay there.",

    "selftext": "Tw for child abuse\n\n\nI am so ashamed that I'd rather reach out to anonymous Reddit than people in real life, for now at least. Because I need to know what I can do about this anger I feel and I'd rather not have the judgment (yet).\nI am 45 and trans (Ftm) I have been on Testosteron since last year. It's actually been beneficial for my mental health.\nI actually feel my boundaries much better now. But that's also the problem. I used to not know what made me angry or upset and that made me feel very depressed for weeks until I dotted the lines. By that time the situation or person that made me angry was already in the past, so no real danger for lashing out. I rarely came back to it, because I felt it was my own fault that I missed the mark.\nI am much closer to myself now and I realise I actually have no clue how to deal with the direct anger at all in the situation.\nSo I go all over the place and it's really Kaboom! So me yelling and slamming doors.\nI have a wife with ADHD and that's a challenge because emontion regulation is something she struggles with as well.\nShe also feels overwelmed a lot and needs to vent to get it out of her system.\nI used to be really good at letting her vent, listening, supporting her and completely pushing myself away because I just didn't recognize my own limits.\nAnd my limits would be reached, but it resulted in depression, headaches, anxiety, crying and overeating.\nSo it was working for her, but I was destroying myself in the process. We have been together for 23 years.\nSince me starting testosteron, I feel better when I am fed up or up set.\nRight now I have no idea how to set my boundaries though and it not ending up in a massive fight. Because all I want when I am tired, is to be left alone.\nBut wife is used to me being non confrontational and now I am not, so it is causing more stress.\nWe also have a 9 year old son, who also has ADHD and autism.\nHe is also not great at emotions, stress or changes.\nWe have had big issues with his behaviour and have been to the therapy center twice.\nWe thought we were getting somewhere but then the local council made a budget cut and basically sold my sons' specialistic after school program to a commercial company and my son is not happy there.\nMy wife is currently in trauma therapy and in menopause (and struggling).\nI just had top surgery and am recovering.\nWe are both tired because of all the shitty things happening that we cannot control but are reaking havoc into our lives.\nWe are complaining, talking until we're blue in the face and everyone is just telling us that it's not their responsibillity that we're in this shit situation.\nIt's just so much and I don't know how to deal with this all.\nAnd I snapped today. My son was challenging in his behaviour when it was bedtime. He was screaming, yelling, running around, running up the stairs, hanging from them, hanging on the sink, threathening to make a mess or destroy stuff and I just lost it.\nI laid him on the bathroom floor and pinned him under me, telling him to stop.\nHe said he would, I let him go and he continued. I then yanked his arm back and used the pain in his wrist to sit him down.\nI continued to twist his wrist so he couldn't move and brushed his teeth. He needs to spit in between so I used the same force to make him spit. He then refused to spit and swallowed. I then cornered him in the bathroom and undressed him.\nI took a wash cloth to wash his face and body, he didn't want me so he hid his face. I grabbed him by his hair and used the leverage to wash his face and body.\nThen he started to cry and my wife came up stairs and told me to go. She was fuming.\nI went down stairs.\nI am not proud of what I did. I lost control of the situation and took it out on him. And this is the third time.\nI really don't want this to happen ever again.\nBut I keep making the same errors.\nI am going to call my GP and tell this story and ask for help.\nI am also contemplating to go to the police and turn myself in. My son is not safe with me. I have proven that. The only reason I am not doing that is because I am not sure if he will be better or worse off with me being in jail. Even though I know I absolutely deserve it.\nI am thinking of stopping with T and starting with sedatives so I can't get angry. Because if anger is being repressed by medication, then I don't have to worry for my own temper.\nBut it will make me very depressed because the testosteron is helping me battle dysphoria.\nI just don't know what to do.\n",

It was basically because I called myself an idiot and a failure because I could not cope with college and we had an argument over it afterwhich he started to hit me really bad.\n\nI wana justify my anger; it's not just anger from what he did in the car: He's done really horrible things before -- cheated on my mom, abused her until she fainted (and then hit her and slapped her until she woke up), abused her when she was pregnant and stole alot of her money form her account when she wasn't earning as much as him. He almost killed her (and attempted to involve me and my sis as accomplices in the murder too) and he almost killed my younger sister too. Yes, we have gone through a court case and received a protection order and if we report him again, he's probably gonna go to prison and my mother does not earn sufficiently to provide for us.\n\nSo in general thinking about all of these things have made me really fucking angry and I have no idea how to get the rage out. Usually I get it out at the gym but my health and injuries have not allowed me to do that either. Sometimes, I think of all this and tremble with anger and I am afriad im losing my sanity and going fking insane",

I have spent enough time to realize that.\n\nIt is not my responsibility to save these people.

    "selftext": "Hey all!  \nFor context I'm 15 and in Australia. I've been severely emotionally, on occasions mildly physically and sexually abused. According to the police and CPS, there's no evidence, so I must be lying.  \nSince I was 10, I've had to deal with mental illness. At first it was your typical cutting, which escalated into suicidality then \"back down\" to passive suicidality. After this, I started having fantasties about hurting people, specifically classmates who didn't treat me that nicely. And I probably started developing anger issues at this point, as I ended up handing a bullies ass to them after school, which wasn't in self defense. I still don't feel sorry about it. Around this time, I started getting a reputation as a pyschopath.\n\nLast year, Year 9, I started getting sicker and ended up relapsing in self harm and suicide attempts. I started going through a cycle of Emergancy department, discharge, be fine for a few weeks then repeat. I was basically made to go into \"family\" therapy, which my mum hated.  \nEventually I started getting admissions, so I started medication, Setraline, which doesn't do shit. And I've just been getting worse and worse. I've been running away, constantly self harming, burning stuff, stabbing stuff, and trying to kill myself around twice a week. Sometimes, I just have like \"fits\" in my bed, jerking my body around uncontrollably cause it feels like I'm fire. I'll ever be full on puppy dog whimpering, or screaming my head off. I started developing intense homicidual urges to literally everyone, especially my mum. I've even prepared some things to kill my mum with, but I've never fully gone through with it because I didn't think it would work well enough. I even want to kill some specific animals, like birds. It feels like I don't feel empathy for anyone except my amazing girlfriend. I often search up gore, or videos of people in pain for the thrill of it.\n\nIt was around a few weeks ago when I got switched to MST pysch therapy, another \"family\" therapy. All the therapist does is pay attention to my mum, and talk about anime with me!? Like no, help me with my issues! And of course, my mum is acting all nice for the public. I apparently can't go to hospital anymore, as I have been banned as they know it's pointless, and also I apparently have a safety plan. Which is bullshit, since I've never heard of this safety plan and nothing has been done about it!\n\nSo yea, I feel pretty fucking hopeless and like a goddamn pyschopath. Does anyone have any ideas? Anything would be appreciated. Thank you!",

The tumor was pressing on my marrow causing immense Pain, which I don’t feel anymore, and I lost the strength and sensitivity in my left hands fingers but am regaining little by little. I’m sleeping well, eating well, but feel incredibly, INCREDIBLY anxious and upset. I’m enraged whenever something happens that upsets me and feel how I get this overpowering feeling of just, anger. I was sleeping one of these days and got woken up by a call to my phone, very suddenly, and I went crazy on the caller (my poor mom, whose intentions I’m aware are not bad, but the opposite). Someone replied to an insta story of mine with a very dumb reply, and I would’ve normally ignored it, but had to absolutely ask them to go to hell when I saw that today. What’s going on? I’m aware I had spinal fluid go everywhere after surgery and that’s part of recovery. I’ve also been on opioids over a month and am set to stop taking them tomorrow. I don’t understand if this surgery may have psychological effects such as this immense distress that I feel, I’m stressing out so much and feeling so angry at everyone. The fact that I haven’t had an hour to myself since 8 days ago also doesn’t help, which makes me feel awful since I appreciate how much company and care I’ve had. Can someone please help me feel like I’m not crazy? I had this surgery happen right on my birthday too, and after having to move out my apartment because my boyfriend broke up with me after 2 years of being together, and 1 year living together. I just haven’t had a break and literally feel like my head is sick too. Again, recovery wise I know I’m on the right path, but the anger and mood swings are so tough on me. Someone saw me wearing a neck brace my Dr advised me to wear, and said I’d have atrophied muscles, and I felt like I needed to bark at them. 🥲 thanks so much for any possible help.

All these things I say to myself about how worthless I am, I am starting to believe them.\n\nThe sad part is that the things I enjoy the most in the world are the things that make me the angriest - playing video games, watching my favorite teams play, trying new recipes, playing sports. I don't understand why it's those things that always do it. I don't want to cut these things out of my life, but I really don't know how to help myself.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I needed to get this off my chest. Really struggling and just don't know what to do.",

    "title": "Why do I get angry when I feel threatened?",
    "selftext": "I wouldn’t say that I’m an angry person on a day to day basis but I do find that my emotions spike and I get outbursts of anger when I feel stressed or threatened in situations where I am not the one in control. Some examples for context:\n1. Today when riding the tram I got my ticket checked, I had taken the wrong receipt from the machine but showed the inspector the payment on my phone. He was dismissive and said I had to get off the tram and buy another ticket, I refused as I had already bought one. Things escalated and I ended up swearing at him and by the end of the interaction I was bawling my eyes out. The inspector was rude from the get go but I think I was really in the wrong here.\n2. When I was skiing last March I fell near where some rangers were trying to do a mountain rescue, one of the rangers started shouting at me to look where I was going and I immediately got confrontational back to him, I think I said he was a psychopath among some other things. I didn’t mean to fall, I’m just bad at skiing and again I was bawling and shaking after the interaction.\nI feel like the common thread here is that I respond aggressively when I feel like I’m being unfairly challenged by people in positions of power. I think if in situations where I actually did think I had done something wrong, I would apologies and move on. I know that the way I respond is not normal, it’s like my emotions shoot up and the outbursts happen before I even catch what I’m doing. Then I get really overwhelmed and upset (I always cry) and I feel so ashamed of myself afterwards. Has anyone ever experienced this and taken steps to change their reactions? I really don’t want to behave this way to strangers who challenge me, it’s embarrassing and it makes me feel bad.\n\nFor some additional background, my boyfriend recently passed away and he was also sick at the time of the skiing incident so I definitely feel less able to cope with things recently but I do still feel like this is a bigger issue as I have always had a short fuse in these situations. I would never start the negative interaction but it is my response that escalates it.",

    "selftext": "It's not always as present as currently but it's kind of always there, always underlying any other emotion. Sometimes it can make me feel stronger and ready to defend myself, stand up for myself. But more often it takes away a lot of energy while I'm trying to manage it. \n\nIt's a debilitating anger. It makes breathing hard and wrenches my gut. And my thoughts get so violent and unhinged that sometimes I'm afraid that at the wrong moment I could just snap and actually hurt someone. There were even moments where I wished that someone, anyone would give me an excuse to aggressively violate them. I get so numb while trying to keep a lid on it. It comes in waves and after a few hours of that anger burning in my stomach I get so numb and sad. \n\nBack in the days I let my anger out on myself, punched me, bit me, threw my head against the wall. I worked a lot on loving myself and I'm mostly at a point where I don't feel comfortable in hurting myself anymore. But now I don't really know how to deal with that intense emotion. I don't know where to channel it to. How to get it out. \n\nI am in therapy and I will talk to my therapist about it. But maybe there are some people here that also experience their emotions on a very physical level and who have found ways of transporting it out of their bodies, giving their nervous system some relief. I cannot confront my abusers who ultimately are the reason for all that anger. And I also don't want to let it out on anyone else. I wish it could just go away. I wish I could just stop being that angry all the time. ",

We’re all pretty close in age (2 years between every kid) so we grew up together. All my siblings have their issues, chronic anxiety, depression, etc. Both my brothers are on the autism spectrum but are pretty low support. They’re entirely verbal, both graduated college, my older brother has a few friends (my little brother struggles more socially). I am also probably on the spectrum but at a different level than either of them. I also have a lot of chronic issues i deal with.\n\nI’m getting a PhD and working at the same time, have my own place, take care of myself, visit home when I can. Our older sister has a career and a home. My brothers have never worked a day in their lives and don’t seem motivated to try. They’re entirely reliant on our parents. For food, laundry, all chores. My mom has suggested my older brother could apply for food stamps to help out with groceries but he refuses because he doesn’t want to do the required phone interview.\n\nI’m just so angry at them all the time because they’re just at our parents’ house doing nothing every day. It might not be fair for me to be so mad, and I know that. But it also just feels so unfair. Our sister and I had to make all the usual steps into adulthood, and neither brother sees anything wrong with waking up at 7pm and playing video games for the rest of their lives. \n\nHow do I stop being so mad?

Life can be bitter sometimes and it's ok if there's a few people who don't like you. I have coworkers that dislike me and I also dislike them back but I don't say anything about it. My philosophy with dealing with people is to just try to ignore them and pretend they're not there. Hard to do, but it took a mindset change. One of my coworkers had tried to get under my skin, got the best of me and got me written up because he knew of my emotional reactions and he was trying to manipulate my anger. Now, I'm always on guard, ready for his next attack, presuming he wants to out me and potentially get me fired. \n\nMy point is: Don't let other people control your anger. They will provoke you into doing something that you will regret. Watch out.

Before I dropped him off, we acted pretty normal but things felt a little tense. He wasn't at my house much longer so when after I dropped him off, I decided to message him and apologize for having that reaction. I overthink a lot but his replies seemed dry to me, even though he said he accepted my apology. Does anyone know how to stop having angry outbursts over virtually nothing?

I haven’t been able to find a job this year after being laid off and the only work I can find is gig work driving or delivering for Uber, and that shit pays barely enough to get by even when I drive during peak times (it seems like no jobs that require a college degree think I’m experienced enough whereas any job that doesn’t require a degree thinks I’m overqualified and doesn’t want to hire me. It seems like no amount of resume adjustments can help me anymore).\n\n\n\nWithin the past few months a few close family members of mine have died and have had to end a few friendships, as well as relationships with my parents and siblings because of the way they’ve treated me in the past.\n\nWith all that said I’m not just angry, I am relentlessly angry. I have tried everything to calm down to no avail. I workout and eat healthy everyday, I take my anti depressants and supplements every day, I’ve tried meditating and mindfulness exercises, writing in my gratitude journal, talking about my feelings to friends, and distracting myself with books, tv, Video games any kind of entertainment to no avail. I feel a little better after doing all these things, but not that much. On a scale from one to ten I feel like my anger goes from a 10 to an 8, then back up to a 10 when I’m not actively trying to calm myself down.\n\nI’m all out of ideas. I’ve tried everything and nothing has worked! I’m going to see a therapist soon but that won’t be for about another month, and in the meantime I’m stuck with no way to cope with these hard feelings.  Someone please help me think of something to calm myself down!\n\n",

My parents side with her leaving all logic behind. As a result I am cooped up in my room 24 hrs a day (I do WFH). As I result, I feel very frustrated. My mom on top of that is super sarcastic to me like comparing me with some random shitty person and every conversation with her is so upsetting and it always ends as me being angry.

My father thinks that I am crazy and tells my mother in front of me to avoid talking to me as much as possible. It is hurtful because, I don't think I am at complete fault here. They just ignore my problems totally even though I have explained to them calmy 100 times atleast. Later when I ignore them for my peace of mind, they come to me and say sorry and start acting cute with me and I start talking normally to them again because I can't ignore them any longer and the same thing happens over and over.  \nI am sick of it.

Pure rage filled in my mind as my breath becomes heavy and forced, and I completely destroy the other person with my words.

I keep a distance from people, and once the rage subsides, I am filled with guilt and shame, and I hate myself.  Being so lonely and isolated,  I have hardly any friends left and a really dysfunctional life. I am depressed and have no motivations or real goals. I have taken refuge in alcohol and weed in the past, and try to stay sober now because having one drink leads to weeks of major dysfunction.  \n\nHow do I get out of this?

Instead of trying to solve it by talking, I cannot control myself and I want to do the same to them to please my own feelings. I once got mad too much, I broke my monitor and ripped my shirt off which I regretted afterwards but I still couldn't stop. I cannot control what to do when I'm angry; my hands and arms go numb, and I sometimes lose my vision and start breathing very fast. Physical damage is also a thing, sadly. I'm trying to solve it out by breathing exercises but they don't seem to work. I need other ways to relax myself most of the time. I feel the need to punch, yell and talk to myself about how dumb or pathetic the other person is. I also look around with empty thoughts and feel like laughing out of nowhere, I mostly laugh at myself for being in that situation. I also start shaking and sweating, I sometimes feel like crying out of anger. What do you think I have? How can I solve this issue about myself?

    "title": "Just finished reading Beyond Anger, changed my perspective",
    "selftext": "I just finished reading this book about anger, and it got me thinking so thought I’d share. It’s called Beyond Anger: A Guide for Men by Thomas Harbin, and I’ve got to say, this book is like having someone grab you by the shoulders and say, “Hey man, look at what your anger is doing to you and everyone around you.”\n\nThe book starts by breaking down what anger really is. Not just that feeling you get when someone cuts you off in traffic, when you’re arguing with your wife or parents, or when your kid spills juice all over the kitchen floor. It’s deeper than that. Anger is like a big, heavy backpack you carry around all day, every day. It’s filled with rocks that keep getting heavier. Rocks from your past, from things people said or did to you, from times when you felt powerless, abandoned, unheard, or hurt but didn’t know how to deal with it. So you get mad. You lash out. You think if you just yell loud enough or hit hard enough, you can unload some of that weight. But every time you explode, you’re not letting those rocks go. You’re just packing them in tighter.\n\nHarbin talks about how anger can feel like power. Like it makes you strong. I get that. When you’re angry, your heart races, your muscles tense, and it feels like you’re ready to take on the world. But that’s not strength. That’s just your body tricking you into thinking you’re strong. Real strength is self control. It’s being able to feel that anger coming on and deciding not to let it take over. Its training your mind to be stronger than the anger, or any other emotion. It’s knowing you’ve got that fire inside you but choosing to keep it in check, to breathe through it, to walk away instead of blowing up and spraying your bullshit all over the place. That’s the hardest thing to do, but it’s what makes you stronger, and more in control, than any punch or scream ever could.\n\nThere’s a part where Harbin explains why we even deal with anger this way in the first place. He talks about how a lot of us, especially men, learned from a young age that showing any emotion other than anger was a weakness. We were taught to man up, to push down the pain, the sadness, the fear. Sound familiar? And the easiest way to do that was to let it all turn into anger, because anger feels tough. It feels like something we can control, something that makes us feel powerful instead of vulnerable. But Harbin breaks it down. It’s all just a lie we were told and a lie we believed. Real courage is facing those feelings, sitting with them, and asking ourselves why are we really mad? Not just turning them into rage because that’s what we know. It’s about breaking that cycle, choosing a new way to deal with what’s going on inside.\n\nThe book gets into some pretty wide range and graphic examples of what happens when you don’t control your anger. It talks about guys (some as young at 15-17) in prison for murder and bar fights. Guys who’ve lost their families, guys who’ve scared their kids away, guys who’ve driven away their wives because they couldn’t keep a lid on it. And that hit me hard. I don’t want to be that guy. I don’t want to be the dad who my kids tiptoe around because they’re scared of setting me off. I don’t want to be the husband who my wife avoids because she doesn’t want another fight. I want to be better than that. I think we all do.\n\nHe doesn’t just leave you there, feeling like shit about yourself. He gives you tools. He talks about learning to recognize your triggers (the things that set you off). For me, it’s when I feel like I’m not being heard or respected. When someone brushes me off or cuts me down, I feel that heat rising in my chest, my jaw starts to clench, and my hands want to curl into fists. But instead of letting it get to that point, I’ve started doing what Harbin suggests. I pause. I take a deep breath (or 20). I count to ten if I have to. I remind myself that I’m in control, not my anger. This is the key to taming it. \n\nAnd yeah, it sounds simple. Maybe even a little silly. But it works. It doesn’t always stop the anger completely, but it gives me enough time to think, to decide how I want to respond instead of just reacting. And that’s made all the difference. \n\nThe book also gets into why we get angry in the first place. It’s not just because someone does something annoying. It’s usually because there’s something deeper going on. Maybe it’s fear (fear of not being good enough, fear of being seen as weak, fear of failing). Maybe it’s pain from something that happened a long time ago that you never dealt with. That’s the stuff that makes your anger flare up at the smallest things. And Harbin makes it very clear - until you deal with that deeper stuff, you’re always going to be a slave to your anger. \n\nReading this book felt like looking into a mirror, but not in a bad way. It made me realize that if I want to be the man I know I can be, I’ve got to stop letting anger be the boss of me. I’ve got to learn to handle it and to feel it, but not be controlled by it. And that’s not going to happen overnight. It’s going to take time, patience, and a whole lot of practice. But if you’re like me, and you’re tired of letting anger ruin your life, this book might just be the thing you need. \n\nIt’s tough love, no doubt about it. There were lots of parts that were hard to read because they made me feel uncomfortable. But it’s the kind of love that makes you want to be better, not just for the people around you, but for yourself. Because when you’re not controlled by anger, you’re free to be who you really are.\n\nAny other books worth reading?",

    "selftext": "My mom would always allow my sister to make fun of me everytime when we were younger. I would tell my mom everytime that I hated her doing it but my mom would always make excuses for my sister saying it's just a joke. Inwould always punch my sister for the shit thay she said to me and my mom would always say I have anger issues because of it. But even when I did just make of her back my mom would give me shit for it. I could never come up with a clever comeback at all and it always pissed me off. I hated how my mom would always excuse what my sister said even it she thinks it's just a joke.\n\nI hate how my mom always seem to go out of her way to help out my sister. One time when we were kids I begged my mom for months to get me a ps3 but she kept telling me that we didn't have any money. But then one day my mom bought my sister a $600 camera for my sister just because she asked her. I was extremely pissed off because she just asked her once and she bought it for her. My sister even told me that my mom always had money she just always told me that we didn't have it so that it'd get me to stop. My sister even said that my mom had no real authority so that she could do whatever she wanted.\n\nWhat annoyed me one time was that back in 2022 I was only working part time and still going to school. I wasn't even making that much for anything. My sister always goes on trips all the time because her boyfriend pays for it. My sister would always give me shit for this whenever I complained about it saying oh just save money. Well I'm not making much and u have someone paying for u.\n\nOne time I asked my mom to help for for a ps5 because I was only working part time and I needed more money. But on that day when she came home she kept saying she didn't have it. And she kept letting my sister but in the whole time. My sister kept saying oh she pays for your car shut the hell up. She them said go live on ur own and get out of here. And I couldn't take it. I know that my mom also helped pay for my sister's car and also gave her money whenever she wanted.\n\nI couldn't control myself when my sister said all those horrible things and then I grabbed the vacuum and I best her up with it. And I don't regret any of it I don't care how that sounds. She said the most retarded shit to me and she always gets away with it and my mom always allows it and because I don't react calmly to it my mom says I have anger issues. A half hr later she calls the cops on me. They handcuffed me and my mom didn't even tell them what my sister said she just said it was the ps5 the whole time and that I have anger issues. I didn't even tell the cop the whole truth because they handcuffed me. I hate my mom for this and I always will. I hate how she made my sister seem like the victim when she fucking said all those horrible things and expected me to just take it all like she always does.\n\nTime afterwards I would beat up my mom for what she had done. And again I don't care how that sounds. She tried to minimize what she had done and act like I should get over it. She always minimizes the dumb shit that she puts me thru.\n\nIn December of 2023 we went to a trip thru the Philippines. For a year we were talking about this trip and I would always tell my mom not to let this trip end up with us barely doing anything like the past few times we went there. And again like she always does she kept promising that my relatives had an itinerary and that they had a lot planned for us.\n\nBut then one day my mom says that they were going on a trip to a springs. I was told that they were going to the store and that they'd be back soon. I waited for hours and them nothing. I had told my mom before we had to do something and not waste anymore time doing nothing this whole trip. We had done a whole 8 hr car ride for nothing just to meet my uncl3s fiancé's family and we didn't even get to actually meet them.\n\n\nWhen my uncle arrived he told me that my mom and aunt were at the springs even tho they had told me they were going to come back. I told him I wasnt told anything and then he just laughed. I got extremely pissed off.\n\n\nI got so pissed off I ended up taking some frames in the room and threw them against the window and it broke them. My uncles and cousin got extremely pissed off at me. Calling me useless and yelling at me. Telling me that they told me where my mom was going and that I was useless and should be ashamed of depending on my mom and that I couldn't even put on my underwear.\n\n\nI told them I was going to kill myself and my uncle just said to go and do it by a bus and not here at the house. I was pissed off as all hell. I was lied to and then they said all this horrible shit to me.\n\n\nMy mom keeps saying she won't give them any shit at all for what they said because they were mad about the window and I told her that doesn't make it ok. All my mom kept doing was pointing at the window and saying loon at what u did. The horrible shit they say was never justified.\n\n\nMy mom keeps defending them this whole time and tries to act like they didn't mean wut they said. Yet they never apologized or even told me they didnt mean it. They refuse to apologize and keep thinking they were justified. All these things my mom has done to me and I hate her even more.\n\n\nI really want someone to tell my mom what they said wasn't justified and calling the cops on ur own son was extremely stupid.",

    "selftext": "When I was a kid I was a happy go lucky child who had a heart of gold. I am the exact opposite of this today. I am an angry piece of shit who is, internally, suffering constantly. I was a bit of a crybaby as a child. My parents were good, except for one thing, they didn't know how to handle me being sad. And neither did... anyone I ever interacted with during my childhood really. I did get sad over stupid, minor things, but nobody ever told me that it wasn't a big deal, nobidy ever reassured me, nobody told me that it was okay. I was instead simply mocked for crying or YELLED AT to stop (even as a kid I thought that was stupid). So, instead of learning that everything was okay and that I was being overdramatic, I learned a different, much worse lesson: never cry in front of other people. So, instead of crying, I began to have anger outbursts. Couple that with the OCD and anxiety disorder which I got from some traumatizing shit that my god awful \"friends\" did to me, I want to cry pretty often, but I instinctively stop myself from doing that when I am in front of others, and I replace it with anger. I don't want to hurt people, I hate the fact that I do this, but I just can't not. It's been so hard for me to unlearn this awful lesson, it's engraved deep in my subconscious. All of this is so unfair, what the hell did I do to deserve any of this? I did nothing wrong as a kid, I was a great person, and now I've been molded into this, a person who doesn't want to hurt anyone but can't stop, a person who's scared all the time, a person who hates themselves. It's beyond unfair, sometimes I genuinely feel hatred towards the universe itself, for being so cruel for no reason.",

The younger monk hesitated, as their order had taken vows not to touch a woman. However, the older monk, without a second thought, picked the woman up and carried her across the river. Once on the other side, the woman thanked him, and the two monks continued on their way in silence.\n\nAs they traveled, the younger monk became increasingly troubled. Several hours later, unable to contain his frustration, he spoke up, “How could you do that? We are monks, and you know we are not supposed to touch women!”\n\nThe older monk calmly replied, “I set the woman down hours ago. Why are you still carrying her?”]\n\nThis one speaks to me and I always think about it when I find myself ruminating or spiraling into an imaginary argument.",

I’m worried that if I don’t get this under control, it might end my engagement.\n\nI don’t let go of things easily. I replay arguments and negative experiences over and over again in my head. On the outside, I might seem chill, but the truth is, I’m often dissociating, lost in reliving these moments. I’ll go from one rage fantasy to another, imagining scenarios where I’m forced to defend myself, often in violent ways. These fantasies scare me because I’m not a violent person, and I never want to be one. But they feel so real that I can’t sit still—I end up twitching, jerking, and by the time I snap out of it, my heart is racing, and I’m breathing heavily.\n\nThis takes a toll on me emotionally, spiritually, and even physically. Heart disease runs in my family, so I know these frequent fits of rage aren’t good for me. I’ve developed constant migraines from clenching my jaw, and now it clicks whenever I open it wide.\n\nI’ve lost count of how many times I’ve made my fiancé cry because of this. I’m so lucky that she’s forgiven me, but I don’t know how much more she can take. Our last fight almost ended our relationship. I promised her I would do better, and for a while, I was. But these thoughts keep coming back, and I spiral. The silver lining is that I’m honest with her about what I’m going through now, and we’ve been able to manage these episodes together. But I want to get to a point where they don’t happen at all.\n\nIt’s hard because my friends and coworkers see me as a kind person, and it makes me feel like a fraud. They don’t see the anger and hatred brewing inside me all the time.\n\nThe good news is that I’m taking medication and actively seeking help. My father was once an angry and violent man, but he recognized his problem and took action. That gives me hope that I can do the same.\n\nI’m not necessarily looking for advice, though I wouldn’t mind it. I just wanted to share my story in case anyone else can relate.\n\nThanks for reading.\n",

I’m typically a very joyful, kind, and docile person, often praised as “an incredible man” by those around me. However, recently I’ve been experiencing severe and prolonged anger that can last for several days. This anger affects my sleep and makes it difficult for me to think clearly.\n\nA recent incident where someone threw a tantrum at me has left me feeling particularly bad. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way—similar situations have triggered these intense emotional responses before. I usually manage to stay calm and composed, but these events seem to push me into a state where my emotions become overwhelming.\n\nAdditionally, my emotions can take a dramatic turn within a few hours, often with no clear cause. One moment I might feel content and upbeat, and the next I’m engulfed by dark, distressing thoughts. This rapid shift complicates my ability to manage my feelings effectively.\n\nDespite feeling a strong urge to act out physically when disrespected or frustrated, I never do so. My fear of my own potential for harm is a significant factor in why I hold back. This fear leads me to isolate myself to avoid any possible negative impact on others. I worry that my need for isolation is a way to prevent myself from causing harm, even though it also means I’m shutting myself off from support and connection.\n\nIf you spent time with me, you’d never guess I’m dealing with these mental health issues, as I try to maintain a positive and approachable demeanor. I don’t use alcohol, drugs, or steroids, which might otherwise influence my behavior.\n\nGiven these recent changes and the intensity of my emotions, I’m concerned about whether this could be indicative of an anger issue. I’d really appreciate any advice or insights on how to better manage these prolonged emotional fluctuations and underlying anger.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and for any help you can offer.",

He lacks emotions, try and get a reaction out of me and when I react I'm the bad person.\n\nI rarely ever talk to him unless it's really important other than that I would forget I had a dad  \n\nI am in ease around him. When at home I generally wear earbuds and that's mainly for him and somewhat for mom. In a sense it's like I get PTSD like symptoms when around him.\n\nHe never have anything good to say about me just this my fault that's my fault. Yes I have faults but I don't deny that never have tried to do that. \n\nII bring up his faults I'm the bad guy. He literally cheated on my mom years ago and had me fooled cause I was unaware at that point.\n\nMoved back in like everything was good. It really affected my mom I could tell. He didn't seem to care and that bothered me. \n\nNow they agree with each other about everything about me how everything is my fault and want to make me feel like I'm crazy) mental.\n\nI am good away from home in general. Unless I left bothered or whatever but I'm generally ok. \n\nThey are part of the reason I have trust issues though. The bad energy, the me being blamed for everything has affected my confidence.\nHe hated when I appear confident.\n\nHe gives the silent treatment, don't have regard when I am talking. He has this energy that he is superior and I am nothing to him. He is unapologetic his energy is dangerous to me. \n\nI rarely go anywhere outside places I have to go and to get away from here but I'm a homebody. \n\nI have some speeding tickets he had to pay and I hate that. But this isn't even about that he has been given these vibes like I say. \n\nIt just got worse as I hv got older. I know th est solution is to have my own place but even if I did? When I do not sure if I can never be healed from this.\n\nHis body language says he is ashamed, he hate me, h regret that I am his son. How do you suppose love a dad like this?\n\nYes I appreciate things he have done financially but he has no regard to mek, my emotions whatsoever never had. How do you love this kind of dad?",

My parents are separated/divorced and this parent started dating (the dating isn’t what pisses me off).\n\nHe said that he didn’t want his brand new girlfriend who he’d seen for maybe a few weeks to be upset.\n\nI am his biological kid and he knew me from birth. He was there when I was born. He’s known me for over 20 fucking years. There were so many times when he didn’t give a fuck if I was upset, unhappy, in discomfort, or even experiencing PAIN. And then he starts dating someone, knows her for perhaps a few weeks, and cares if she’s upset.\n\nThis may sound very harsh, but I just want to scream at him: Who the fuck cares if someone you met recently and want to fuck/sleep with is upset? You never cared if I WAS UPSET. You never cared if your previous partner was upset. You never stood up for me, not fucking once.\n\nI think parents who aren’t present are better than parents who never stand up for their kids.\n\nEven at such a young age with no romantic partner in my life, a man is more concerned if another woman is upset than if I am in fucking pain.\n\nI feel like so many men are the most shallow and superficial human beings. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying ALL men on Earth are, and there are women who are very shallow and superficial, too. But what I’ve learned about men is that you can be around them for 20 years or longer. If they aren’t sleeping with you, they won’t care about you or won’t care that much. But if you sleep with them, they instantly start caring. They’re very shallow and most of them only care about one thing.\n\nI’m angry at my own body because it’s pretty much unresponsive and fully turned off sexually. I also suspect I have vaginismus. Having vaginismus mixed with what I’ve learned about men has totally changed my view of relationships. I think what is shown in movies and TV shows (“true love”, happy romantic relationships between men and women) are scams sold to people (mainly girls and women). They don’t tell you that men’s love is conditional on whether your body works or not. They don’t tell you that it seems like PIV is the only thing that matters to men and if you’re a woman whose body can’t do that, you have so little worth to men.\n\nI’m just pissed and tired of bullshit.",

For example me and girl(F20) I(M18) liked began getting closer (hanging out everyday, spending nights with eachother) we went to a party and a guy asked me if we were together because when he asked others they’d mention my name. I assured him that we weren’t together and he went and made his move, he took her home and they did what people do. I wasn’t mad I was more disappointed in the fact it happened so quickly but I realize that maybe that was the perfect time. A day later she called me and said that I had been “pillow talking” and that I had been telling people she was my girlfriend. This utterly infuriated me because I felt like she had no right to assault my character by calling me a pillow talker. I told her that I had been telling people the opposite of what she’s heard but she didn’t believe me. So I just started pretending that she never existed. Any mentioning of her name is met with “who?” “I don’t know that person” and whenever I’m around her in public I look right past her, I feel bad but it feels good not to speak to her or even look at her. It may sound like I’m bitter about them hooking up, but I’m not. At first I thought I was but then I realized that I could just go do the same thing. So I did. Pretending that she didn’t exist has been very easy for me. Lately I’ve been starting to miss hanging out with her. But I will not stop pretending. Someone whom can’t believe me can’t be someone I give any time to. I thought I loved her for a time being. I’m pretty sure this is a defense mechanism because I was actually hurt by her. But I don’t know how she could’ve hurt me besides her assaulting my character. When asking others opinions they said that I’m just salty that she doesn’t want me. But I never cared whether she wanted me or not because I was in it for the experience. I wanted to experience her and all she had to offer but I still knew my bounds. I knew not to even mention a title and I never did. It disgusted me the way she spoke about me. She spoke as if she had always thought I would do that. I think she overreacted and I overreacted to her overreaction ",

    "title": "Need Advice on Life/Anger (23M)",
    "selftext": "Hello all, I'm a 23 year old guy who just graduated college and has been working full time for almost a year; I majored in engineering. Ever since graduation life has been an adjustment and a lot of it is dealing with loneliness as my college and high school friends live scattered across the country. I live at home because my job is in my hometown and I'm saving up money yet I still feel unsatisfied. I bought a car after a few months of working with my own money and that has been good but my patience in general is just very low and I feel increasingly angry a lot (although I never show it or take it out) and I feel like I'll snap. I go on dates occasionally through the apps but I am nowhere close to a relationship nor have I ever been in one; it just never happened and sometimes I'm okay with it but sometimes I feel like I messed up. No one tells me what's wrong with me either. I don't know what to do to make myself feel better and I always hold grudges and resentment towards people in the past who brought me down. I thought the money would help but I always just feel like my bank balance isn't high enough. I do have one hobby, photography, which I semi regularly do and have done for a while. I recently got back more to it after college.\n\nPeople who were less accomplished than me in terms of school/career have told me a while back that I was emotionally behind on a lot of things in life just because I had never been in a relationship. I also find it funny how people feel free to tell me this stuff but when I say stuff back to them suddenly I'm the bad guy and get accused of \"acting like a victim\". I also worry that women will think there's something wrong with me if I tell them l've never been in a relationship; I've been laughed at before when I said that by someone and some of my dates are somewhat surprised when I tell them that (that is not a diss on them)\n\nWhat if I find myself triggered by even small things, I think my patience has just run out in general. I used to do martial arts for many years when I was younger but I stopped when I got busier with high school and college. I am appreciative for my job, car, and money that I have. Maybe I am greedy but I am a person who strives for more. It is also hard seeing people my age with unlimited PTO or spoiled brats who get their cars and vacations funded by their parents. If anyone deserves that it should be someone who actually works for it.",

Recently because his stocks value went down slightly his parents have been nagging him that he \"should have sold the stock\" when they had told him to, which triggered a lot of rage in him.\n\nIt's been the 2nd/3rd time this month and he got enraged yesterday night, saying a lot of mean things especially about his mother, who became a housewife to care for him and his sibling. He started talking about how useless his mother is and how none of them have a right to comment anything since they don't have anything to back up their advice, and then started cursing out his mother and saying that he wanted to \"slit her throat\" and kill her for what she said. \n\nI'm sure he didn't really mean it but I got upset and although I didn't say calm down, I didn't really verbally de-escalate the situation before telling him clearly that I don't like him talking about his mother like that, even though I know what she said upset him. He got really angry and took it that I \"didn't support him\" and blocked me, and now our messages seem to have all been deleted right now.

And he never forgets or forgives. I have no clue how to talk him anymore. And it’s so confusing. Cuz I know my brother loves me. My brother will go to the ends of the world for me, but I can’t help feeling like he fucking hates me. Like literally despises me, resents me, and hates me. \n\nHe wasn’t always like this. He went through a divorce years ago and he’s been miserable ever since. I have never said that to him. I have never called him miserable and I don’t bring up his divorce or his change in demeanor because maybe the two aren’t even linked. I don’t confront him about his anger at all. And I’m not saying that I’m perfect. I am not the best person to be around all the time, either. And boy has he let me know that I have not been the person he’d like me to be. But so much less bothers me and, lately, I’m feeling like I can’t really relate to how angry he gets. \n\nHow do I handle someone who is so angry all the time? I’m not looking to change him. I don’t want to confront him. I’m looking for a way to be on good terms with my brother. ",

I cannot reply back when people ask me questions, I only know how to say a few words correctly. Anyway, I'll be just sitting on the couch minding my business and then comes my nan to ask me 50 questions, either ab food or something else. If my grandpa talks to me, it's to comment on my pale skin or skinny figure, which has genuinely started to annoy the fuck out of me, and they're blaming it on the fact I don't eat much but I have a fast metabolism so even if I ate alot there'd be no difference. They keep assuming stuff and I just agree in hopes they leave me alone but then they have more questions, It's gotten to the point that I loudly sigh or just ignore their existence completely when they talk to me. Furthermore, all italians do is complain, complain, complain and complain. I've genuinely stormed out of rooms because its not like I can reply anyway. A child had a tantrum today because I wouldn't let it touch my stuffies, and I was inching closer to a crash out, I have 14 more days here and I'm so close to putting my hands on someone. All I've heard for the 3 days I've been here is \"You're so skinny\" \"You're so pale\" \"Why don't you talk\" \"Why don't you do something instead of staying home\" \"Why don't you eat\" continuously hearing these questions.

    "selftext": "So when I was in high school I had..(or rather still have) ADHD. There was one teacher who had the most annoying voice to the point during lectures I would just zone out in my head. One day he was talking for so long I just felt this grating feeling growing inside while I had my head down.. Got to a breaking point and just yelled \"shut the fuck up!\". He instantly said go to the principal which I did. Principal walked me back to class and said I could apologize or get suspended for 3 days. I took the suspension (I had the rebellious reputation at school to uphold lol). Now here is the thing...I was not really an angry person at that time...very chill dude in fact. My question is why something that was annoying to me built up to a point where I yelled that to a TEACHER in front of the whole class. Happened once with my mother and stepdad arguing all the time and one day I yelled shut up. (I have a black mom) She made me sit outside in the freezing cold with just boxers and all my friends were outside too. Thanks all for reading and the basic gist is has anyone experienced this and what in my mental caused these spontaneous reactions. To this day I still get those feelings where something annoying is happening around me and slowly building up inside and either react harshly or just telling myself let it pass. Have a great day!",

I have been diagnosed bipolar disorder and even though i dont have insurance I see the local clinic that takes payments for my mood stabilizers. i dont feel manic. i dont have crazy thoughts or excessive emotions in any other level. i literally explode and feel like i completely different person. i act and do things that is complete opposite of who i want to be/am.

It used to be in a milder form, but a couple of months ago I discovered that I could offend her. Now it is becoming more frequent, and about once every 2-3 weeks we have major quarrels. My girlfriend (I do not want to say that I am right though) often does not leave me alone during a quarrel, when I ask, and tries to escalate the conflict discussing the things I might have done wrong. It makes me angry, and sometimes I start insulting her and saying all sorts of hurtful things. But today we had a terrible conflict again, and out of anger, I tore up the felted wool toy that she gifted me for my birthday. After that, she decided to tear up my workbook, and I snatched it out and hit her with it on her cheek. Not that it would be a really painful hit, but the fact remains. I hit my girlfriend and ruined what she presented with all her heart. Now I realize that I am not much different from my father, who beats my mother as well.\n\nPlease help me. I realize that I have crossed an invisible line and am at the point of no return. I'm just a monster who doesn't deserve his girlfriend. But I love her, and she loves me too.

I am 26 years old and I still cannot stop exploding like I’m 16 again.\n\nI guess I should add that I have a cat, and WOULD NEVER AND WILL NEVER HURT HIM. After an episode he sometimes shows up looking at me and I most of the time calm down and feel like shit for scaring him. He jumps up and I scratch his chin. Again, I wanna reiterate for everyone, this cat is my boy, and I wouldn’t lay a finger on him.\n\nSorry for all the swearing, I guess that’s just how I communicate when I’m not level headed.\n",

    "selftext": "I haven't written in a while.  I want those of you who do have a lot of anger inside of you like myself.  It is possible to get calm and learn better coping methods. Trust me your feelings are valid, you feel them and anger and rage is the strongest emotion right next to hate. IT IS NOT EASY. It really isn't. Vulnerability is what worked for me, with myself, with others. Anger is us usually defending our vulnerabilities. \n\nI'm going to tell you what I have been doing that has been helpful and give a few examples.   \n- I have luckily been introduced to a group of dudes that talk to each other each week about the good and bad in our week, and what we plan on doing in the next week. We give each other 'tasks' to do to work on ourselves.  **This has helped me extremely. It's rare for men to listen to each other. Men having tears stream down their faces.** *Men mask their feelings because of socialite norms. Masking pain.*\n\n  \n- I have been *practicing* **FORGIVENESS**. It's never easy to forgive one another. But you can forgive others for the same you've done and forgive others for simple things. We all do bad things whether we like to admit it or not. I hate admitting it and I always do. *When you get angry at someone on the road just say to yourself* \"I FORGIVE YOU I FORGIVE YOU!\" - **Something as subtle as that really has been helping me.**\n\n- I have been journaling my days and fears. *I Know it sounds like pussy shit, but it works for me.* I used to write in a journal randomly and a lot when I was on drugs. I suggested to these group of dudes to start it and they have been doing it. The growth they are showing, and the positive energy they are giving off is amazing. I'm proud of them.  **I have been doing the same**. Two days ago I wrote two pages, fears, insecurities, what's trouble me. Sometimes logging your days really helps. I have been eating junk food, sleeping terribly, haven't been working out, I've been a little manic, I'm dehydrated and being lazy. That's been causing tons of frustrating in me. The anger I have felt recently is intense, but It's always tamed by the time I look back at the ***LOG/JOURNAL***. I read and think \"oof damn, three PB&J's? 5 hours of sleep? No water? I didn't shower since Friday its Monday dude? I didn't sleep well again, I drank too much caffeine too! OOOF\"\n\n- I totally respect your religious views. Church helps a lot. I found some verses that I like and honestly it helps. You don't have to be religious for Church. You may be able to find the right people though, people like you needing someone to listen. I noticed their are extremely judgmental religious people and their are those that want the best for you no matter your belief. It's not easy I know, but that's super helpful in my life. \n\n-I wont lie on this one. I have been choosing times to cry if I can. We all have suppressed emotions, and anger helps that. We suppress fears and our true fears behind anger. It's a fact. Think of an aggressive dog. The dogs who are most scared attack right away. That dog wasn't born like that. That dog is afraid and needs to be nurtured and loved. We all need that, sometimes we don't get that, but it's out there. \n\n-Just because you lashed our or screamed or punched a wall ***DOES NOT*** make ***YOU*** a ***BAD*** person. It doesn't, you were reacting off of feelings to defends yourself. ***IT IS NATURAL***. Don't be afraid to apologize and know that person won't forgive you. MEAN IT. OWN UP TO IT.\n\n-Physical health: hygiene, eating, hydration, and style. Shower up, I think we all get a little antsy feelings gross and sweaty. Brush your teeth, small things help.  Lotion up, clean your clothes and bed sheets.  \nChange up that eating too, healthier options out there; yeah life's expensive, but you dont need that junk food to live. You DON'T that shits messing with your dopamine. You don't need that coffee at all, you're heart is beating without it and it's preventing a good nights sleep.   \nDRINK WATER.... simple. Drink 64 oz's of water. YOU drink it and boom it's done. I don't care how much you pee, clean those toxins out.  It truly helps, I don't care what you say. stop the soda, you don't need it.  \nChange some clothes around, boost some confidence, new hairstyle, new clothes or maybe try a new pattern of clothing you wear. \n\nThe only thing you are in control of is yourself. IT'S NOT EASY. That person who cut you off driving yeah that sucks and it's annoying, but if you didn't get into an accident, they probably will later on. Let them learn their lesson if they do.   \n  \n\"THAT PERSON LOOKED AT ME FUNNY AND SAID SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE!\" This upsets me, but guess what there will ALWAYS be someone like that, even if they are saying it in another language. Sometimes people put others down to boost themselves.   \n- Think of a bully as someone drowning. They are drowning and are pulling you down to keep their head above water. \n\nA quote I like and I might be getting it wrong, but it's \"The axe forgets. The tree always remembers.\"   \n- Don't be the axe\n\nMessage if you need to vent things out. It's all good. The grass is greener even if you gotta plant seeds in a dirt field. ",

    "title": "I am Autistic (27F), and have no clue how to engage with my Autistic partner's (26M) anger-meltdowns without causing him to explode even more.",
    "selftext": "This is kind of long, but I feel like my relationship is about to end over this.\n\nMy partner and I met on a dating website while he was off at work (he works for 2 months at a time on a ship, and comes home for one or two months at a time). He asked me to be his girlfriend before returned, and I was thrilled - I haven't felt this connected to anyone in years. However, upon his return home and our first meeting, our relationship took a dramatic turn. Many of his behaviors align with common autistic traits (he says himself he thinks its possible, and that a few of his friends have pointed out this possibility to him as well), and his history of trauma, including physical abuse from a parent and bullying growing up, has significantly impacted his communication style and emotional regulation.\n\nOur conflicts escalate rapidly, even from minor disagreements. When I express hurt, he perceives it as a personal attack, insisting I'm trying to manipulate him. He views arguments as battles to be won, and any attempt to de-escalate is seen as a tactic to gain an advantage. This defensive stance prevents open dialogue. His frequent accusations of me using \"therapy-speak\" (I've been in therapy for 8 years - almost a third of my life - so I can't even identify what is or isn't therapy speak, and he won't tell me exactly what it is when I ask). I'd love to just give him space when he's mad, but he weaponizes this by demanding a day away (during the limited time we have together, during which I've barely seen him), and he uses that day to come up with more arguments to \"prove me wrong\" not actually introspecting and thinking about maybe how I'm feeling or ways to express how he's feeling more clearly. Just ways to \"win\", which means he comes back even angrier and ready to fight. When I explain that I don't know how to deal with his anger, he maneuvers my speech/what I'm communicating with him to \"prove\" that he doesn't have anger management issues, and that I'm just a manipulative person that can't get what I want, and that he's stopping that. I think he views most people that are not close to him like this, thanks to the treatment from his parent and childhood bullies (since this is so oddly specific).\n\nHis inability to acknowledge my feelings is overwhelming. For example, me saying something like, \"When you said X, it hurt my feelings. Can we talk about that?\" It's, \"Okay, so you're saying this is all my fault then?\" I read in an anger management thread that people with autism can experience \"anger meltdowns\" and memory lapses during these heightened emotional states. I've witnessed this in him during arguments, where he'll be irreparably angry, and he'll say some of the meanest, harshest things when he doubles down, further complicating our interactions. It's like he realizes his own argument is kind of childish or unfair, and has told me that he's afraid of me rubbing his nose in it, so he pre-emptively just kind of just defaults to insulting things like the way my voice sounds (Stuff that has 0 to do with the argument and is just hurtful). He says I'm \"trying to hurt him\" by telling him he's at blame (I'm not trying to hurt him OR place all blame on him) so he \"fights back\". I am incredibly flustered and take longer to say what I need to when people are accusing me of things, cutting me off, or generally being combative very suddenly like he does, and when I ask him to stop this, he rushes me to force a complex thought into 20 seconds, or he WILL cut me of to tell me I'm \"rambling\". But when I speak in a single sentence or two, he'll interpret it the worst way possible, and when I attempt to elaborate, he doesn't want to hear it.\n\nAvoiding sensitive topics like politics has been futile, as conversations inevitably escalate into arguments. He seems fixated on assigning blame and avoiding accountability. I've discovered he has a systematic approach to conflict resolution focused solely on determining fault, rather than understanding the other person's perspective. For example, he explained to me, \"Whenever we have a problem, I have a list of questions I ask myself, like how I could have possibly seen the conflict coming, and that's how I determine if it's my fault. I'm not a mind-reader.\" Every time I tell him something is wrong, I don't even tell him things like, \"You should have been able to tell that I'm mad.\", and will remind him that I am not asserting he should have known anything, and it doesn't matter. This rigid mindset hinders our ability to connect and resolve issues - the point of conflict is to have a discussion to understand eachother and come to a solution, not determine blame. I don't know if maybe we need to come up with a new list together? I'm unsure.\n\nI'm desperate for guidance on how to navigate this toxic dynamic while preserving my emotional well-being. I'm at a loss of what to do here.",

    "selftext": "I was holding it in for so long. Long story short, my sister didn't grow up with us. My mom was young and single and already struggling to raise me. So she gave my sister up for adoption. Sister grew up as an only child in a super religious household. I don't blame my mom for that, she didn't know. She did what she thought was best. But I know other people with similar home lives as my sister who also act the same as her. A strong victim mindset. You can't have a different opinion or try to educate her on something without her getting upset. If you express your own opinion, she takes it as you being angry with her and she'll immediately close up. She reads too much into people's reactions. She thinks everyone is out to get her. One time she was crying and told my mom that her friend died. My mom later found out that the \"friend\" was a voice actor my sister met once. My sister tries to take time off work for celebrity deaths. I was sad about Matthew Perry but I didn't try to call out of work for it. That's insane to me. She just needs so much attention and for everything to go wrong all the time so she can be a victim. I don't think she does it on purpose, but it's something she needs therapy for and she's refusing to get help. Yesterday I finally snapped on her. We had different opinions about the lack of representation in Genshin Impact. I understand people are upset about it and it does suck. But at the end of the day, it's Hoyo's game and they can do whatever they want with it. I told my sister that I just have bigger issues in my life than being mad at a video game. And of course she overreacted. She told me that she feels like she's just ruining everyone's life and should just shut up. Which is not what I said at all. It's an insane reaction. I just couldn't deal with it anymore and I told her she's being too dramatic. I told her she has a victim mindset and she needs a therapist. Because I can't deal with it anymore. She didn't say much, but she seemed to understand and said she would look into getting help. But somehow I just doubt she's going to. I don't know what else to do. I just pray I don't get to the point where I might punch her.",

Initially I was angry and told them to never expect the same from me ever again and then that angry-crying just turned into sad crying. And I sad-cried while I made myself some avocado toast 😔 and also a little as I ate the toast. \nPost-first toast and I’m fine again 😃\n\nI definitely overreacted but I think my anger was a tiny bit justified this time…",

    "title": "Am I a becoming a horrible person?",
    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nA little back story about me. I (27F) was raised with two siblings and I am the middle child. Me and my elder(6 years than me) sister were never compatible. I love her but she has inflected some serious traumas on me. She used to beat the crap out of me and shout at me. Now I have distanced myself from her. We talk very rarely. \n\nMoving on to my teen years, I started developing some serious anger issues. I used to slam doors, yell at my sister and my mother and even cut myself to release anger and other horrible emotions I was feeling. I always felt like I wasn't getting enough attention. \n\nOnce I was sexually abused by my tution teacher but at the same time I was dating a guy who was 8 years older than me, who my family didn't approve of. So when I told my mother about the abuse, my sister told her that I am lying and she saw me on a motorcycle with my boyfriend. I was with him but I was returning from my tution classes after being abused. After seeing my mother's reaction I didn't bother to clarify myself.\n\nForwarding to my adult years. After my college I moved out of my home and since then I have been living in different cities. I stopped cutting myself and I was feeling okay, I think I do not remeber that much.\n\nThen covid hit and I moved back home for a year, started dating my childhood friend I was okay until then. But then my father passed away, he was the only one who used to call me daily when I was living out. I cared for him, I loved him and I don't know but it hit me really hard. I was shattered.\n\nAfter my father passed away, I took over all his responsibilities including my younger brother's education and my mother's well being. I was always close to my brother, and got close to my mother also after my father's death.\n\nI again moved out and started living with my boyfriend. I still had my anger issues. I used to release my anger on him. At first he was shocked because he never saw me or anyone behaving like this. I always apologised but soon my apologies stopped meaning anything to him. I tried to work on myself for him and I think we came a long way and he helped me a lot. Listened to me, tried to support me and I did the same for him. We became a happy couple.\n\nTwo years back I started smoking a joint few times a week as it used to calm me and then daily and then few days back I realizes that I am getting addicted to it now. As I don't want to become an addict, so I have stopped it completely. \n\nThe things have worsened since then. Earlier I was sometimes able to control myself but now it seems like a impossible task. My mind forces me to say the most hurtful things to my boyfriend. I can't believe what I am becoming.\n\nI don't know how to apologize, I have already apologised so many times that now my sorry means nothing even to me. \n\nI have been thinking of talking to a psychologist but I am afraid they will just label me as a bad person, but I am not a bad person. I badly want to change.\n\nI am not a bad person but I am definitely becoming one. What should I do? Any advice, any tips, anything would be helpful please. Even a reality check would help.",

    "title": "Lost and broken",
    "selftext": "Being lost and broken is like living in a maze with no exit. You hurt others because you’re desperate to find a way out, and in that desperation, you lash out, trying to claw your way to some semblance of control. A lost man is a frightened man, and a frightened man is dangerous.\n\nWhen you're broken, it’s like carrying a bag of shards inside you. Every movement, every interaction, sends those shards slicing through your insides. The pain is constant and consistent. So, what do you do? You try to offload that pain onto others, hoping that if they hurt as much as you do, it might lessen your own agony. It never does, of course. It just spreads the pain around, like a virus.\n\nA broken man lacks a sense of self. He doesn’t know who he is, what he stands for, or where he’s headed. He’s floating in a sea of confusion and self doubt. When you don’t know who you are, you can’t truly connect with others. Your relationships are shallow, based on fear and insecurity rather than love and trust. You push people away because getting close means exposing your wounds, and that’s fucking terrifying.\n\nHurting others becomes a way to keep them at arm’s length. If they get too close, they might see the real you. The scared, broken little boy hiding behind a facade of toughness. Stunted in immaturity. So you build walls, fortresses of anger, resentment, and hostility. You convince yourself that you’re protecting yourself, but really, you’re just isolating yourself further.\n\nThere’s also a twisted sense of power in hurting others. When you feel powerless in your own life, inflicting pain can give you an immediate sense of control. It’s a dark, poisonous control, but it feels better than the helplessness that haunts you. You become a master manipulator, using others’ vulnerabilities to mask your own. You use your anger like a weapon, cutting down anyone who threatens to expose your weakness.\n\nBut here’s the truth - it’s all a lie. The control, the power, the anger. They’re illusions. They don’t make you strong, they make you a coward. They don’t heal your wounds, they deepen them. And the more you hurt others, the more you hurt yourself. It’s a vicious cycle, a downward spiral that can only end in more pain and brokenness.\n\nBreaking free from this cycle requires brutal honesty and a courage. You have to face the darkness inside you, confront the demons that drive your behaviour. You have to take stock of yourself. You have to own your pain, your fear, and your shame. You have to acknowledge the damage you’ve done, to yourself and others, and commit to doing better.\n\nIt’s about accountability. You have to take responsibility for your actions, no matter how painful it is. You have to apologize, not just with words, but with actions. You have to show those you’ve hurt that you’re committed to change, that you’re willing to do the hard work to become a better man.\n\nIt’s also about empathy. You have to learn to see others as more than just targets for your pain. You have to understand their feelings, their struggles, their humanity. You have to connect with them on a real, deep level, beyond your own fear and insecurity.\n\nBeing lost and broken doesn’t have to be a life sentence. It’s possible to find your way, to heal, and to become whole. But it requires a willingness to face the truth, to embrace vulnerability, and to take responsibility for your own life. It’s a journey, a tough, painful journey, but it’s worth it. Because in the end, it’s the only way to stop the cycle of hurt and find true peace and strength.\n\nSo to all the lost and broken men out there: I see you. I’ve been you. And I know how hard it is. But I also know that you have the power to change. You have the strength to break free from the chains of anger and pain. You have the capacity to heal, to grow, to become the man you were always meant to be. It starts with a single step, a single decision to face the truth and take responsibility. And from there, the journey begins.",

But I thought at 23 years old, I would find a way to work through my issues (childhood blah blah blah), but every time I’m faced in real-time with somebody talking down to me, I feel myself start to almost boil-over and pour out of my own skin. The fact is that I’m ashamed of my inability to master my own emotions… and I’m afraid I’m going to lose this new job that I went through (still going) some times so hard I thought I wouldn’t make out… Anyways:\n\nToday was an eye opening experience for me, and I’m afraid I’m more damaged than I can understand myself. I’m learning new functions at this job that I’ve never done before. It’s a new world to me, honestly. I tend to get in my own way and can’t keep my focus 100% on where I am. Sometimes I’m so deep in my own thoughts that I second guess myself into making small “mistakes” that anger people. I’ve done it my whole life. Since I was a kiddo, I could be too quiet (tended to be to myself) and piss my family off at get together… back on topic: I made a co-worker upset with me, man. I missed something small and it caused an easy to fix problem, but I needed help because I just got to the position that day. The lady starts giving me an earful with a nasty attitude. My first move now that I’m older and learned the hard way is to defuse any situation, it doesn’t matter who is at fault. I’ve seen things go south, and I’ve gone south. lol. Well, she kept going, and that’s ALWAYS when I feel it: The heat. And I know I have to get out of the situation… But she’s in my face. “Stop doing it the way he showed you, (a job function move that works) I’m TELLING you to *insert her way*! You’re getting paid x amount of dollars (not great money, but it’s good enough for the work)” etc ect. Anyways, I stop her and try to explain what happened, that I had just missed it and I was sorry, but she wasn’t having it. Imo, it was an easy fix and not a problem, but she persisted… I say “I treat you with respect, so stop talking to me disrespectfully. I’m a human being too.” She then goes to say, in an aggressive and rude way, that she tried that. (she didn’t.) That was when I snapped. I took a step closer and told her she had to get away from me, now, with a “thanks you” And she did. She took off and went back to her station. At this point, I am practicing my breathing, and going back to work… But it’s not working at all. All the BS that I have tried to learn and all that zen shit just leaves me… every time. But this way different. I had a real adrenaline dump going through me. It was intense, and would settle in my hands. Almost like ants crawling on them. I think trying so hard to change and not let my anger ruin my life anywhere, it kind of scared me that I couldn’t stop it. I kept working and tried to show my coworkers that I wasn’t angry, but how? I felt like I was preparing a battle or something. This kind of feeling makes you believe you are just a tool for **ever** thinking you could control your emotions. I managed not to start destroying everything around me, like my brain was screaming at me to do. While I was closing my eyes and breathing, singing Elvis to myself haha (I think I can use that to trick myself to stop by singing slow songs to myself), the rush was so strong that I thought I was going to pass out. I took off and clocked out ASAP and was trying to control my breathing until I got in the door, and my heart was still racing. \n\nI try to set an example for the younger people I meet and work with. I have had to learn everything in life the hard way, it’s the only way I learn. I seriously take the fellas younger than me aside and try to give them advice when I see them on similar paths I’ve been down, because I know I didn’t have anyone looking out with basic game on how to be in an adult environment… but It made me realize that I was a fraud. Thoughts? Answers? Am I screwed? I haven’t been that angry but maybe a once or twice that I can remember at all… I think she activated my fight or flight, and I was growing wings. I’m worried that if she has been a man, I’d be in handcuffs and jobless… Back to fighting not to get evicted **again** (nearly did when I quit my last job)",

So I take it out on my car (steering wheel and the thing that holds my phone, which of course broke,) and my voice, which I destroy with a guttural scream. Once again, obvious problem, and once again, too proud to admit it.\n\nTwo weeks later…\n\nI am playing a relatively competitive shooter game, The Finals. I am not particularly good at this game, but it still frustrates me very often for my own reasons. That said, my general frustration with the game and outright tearing every key off my keyboard are two separate kinds of anger. (It was a mechanical keyboard so there was no actual damage to it, I just had to put all the keys back on their switches.) Once again, obvious problem, once again, too proud to admit it.\n\nAnd that brings us to tonight.\n\nI was playing SSBU on a completely different switch, and I lose a match. So I break the poor thing over my knee, cracking some of the plastic chassis, and cracking the screen, rendering many pixels dead. \n\nSo finally it hit me. I have some nasty anger issues, and I don’t know how to manage them. \n\nIt isn’t the same way when I am around other people, I tend to be able to control myself around others, this only really happens when I’m alone.\n\nI want to stop destroying things when I’m angry. It’s a waste of my money, and I will feel perpetually guilty every time I do it.",

Then when i was going to home i decided to take another route for the first time. İ went to towns cemetery to see my grandma. İ went to my grandmas grave. Told her about my girlfriend. She left me and came back wanted be together again and some more details. İ sad to my grandma we were triying to fix everything and cried there a little bit. Then i drove to home. Sudenly i saw her car near a park and decided to say hi to her. İt was 11 30pm i walked to the park and saw her with another man. They were sitting on a bench side by side and the guys hand was over her shoulder. İ sad what are you doing in here. The boy sad we are chatting in a way that is bastardy. She tried to talk to me i show my hand for her to shut up and left there. İ wanted her to come to me and make an explain but she just choose to sit with this man. İ become more angry. İ knew i had to leave there but i went to park again she then came with me. İ wanted an explanation. What she was doing with a man in the middle of the night side by side sitting ? She sad they were at the gym then went to beach. When i heard they went to beach i was frusturated. Felt so angry, that i loose my shit. İ was nearly going to beat her up. İ remember the fear in her eyes, it was pure fear. İt is the first time that i ever felt this angry to choose violence. İts a shame for me. İ was the who suppose to protect her. İ was the one who has to defend her no matter what. Now i feel like a loser who choose anger over calmness. But this anger is actually a product of things happened over time. \n\nFor the situation\n1) She usually texts me every day. That day no text\n2) it is in the middle of the night\n3) in a park ( which we used to hang out and make out)\n4) sitting side by side and his arm was around her (it took me mounths to get that relax with her)\n5) their too relax atitude \n6) spending time with someone else rather then me\n\nFor things thats piled up\nWe used to be in a long distance relationship and she was always spending time with male friends. \nShe started to spend less time with me \nStarted to care less about me\nOne time i called her for a good news in my life. Halfway she sad i got things to do but i can hear her friend talking leta go bla bla.\nShe was emotionally cheating on me i think and when i tried to talk her about this she gets angry and shuts me up. She didnt listened to me.\n\nEnding\nSo in this situation i got angry to be cheated emotionly again so i choose anger. Next day her mums work partner who is like a father to her called me and sad if i ever contact her again they will use law. He sad after i settle my anger up he wated to talk to me man to man and sad there was nothing cheating going on. May be yes there were no cheating but everyhing was piled up and i choose anger. İt is a shame for me to choose anger. İ still love her after all have done. İ wanted to apologise to her but i cant. They do not allow it. May be after talking to him he can let me apologise to her.\n\nİ have already read seneca about anger and that man frequently tells me that anger is bad but i guees until ypu do it you do not realise how bad it is to do something like that",

He started saying how what I wrote is wrong and it should be his way. Even though \"his\" way is what we've been told to never do and costs us money and product waste! And then he adds that I should be doing the math differently for a formula and goes on for about 15 minutes. Then he does the math and realizes the resulting value is identical.\n\n\nThe next day we have a machine go down so I stop production as we are supposed to do for quality reasons. After we get it running again he tells me I shouldn't have stopped because there's a backup machine. Except that is not our policy and that machine isn't meant as a backup. Everything I do is never right I guess!\n\n\nSO I am avoiding talking to him and as I am extremely livid and he picks up on this. And as he always does in this case, he punishes me by giving me late break coverage. He sits upstairs and watches Youtube. He finally comes down and I said \"Did you forget I go at 6:30?\" First he says he was upstairs \"WAITING\"(???) and \"Looking for his hat!\" then switches to telling me I have never gone at 6:30...\n\n\nThere were other things he did this week but I am just fuming right now. He is smart and \"always right\" kind of person and always butts in to \"prove\" how smart he is by just being contrarian. He's a total piece of shit and has gotten in major trouble for making the girls cry multiple times for screaming at them.\n\n\nHe had a lavish lifestyle until his business failed in Hong Kong where he lost millions and now slums it with us. How the fuck do I deal with him?\n\n\nI cannot describe how much I hate him. Its hard to deal with him as well because of his \"always right\" attitude. I don't know how I can win with someone like that.\n\n\nI have confronted him before and he has said I am over reacting.",

Please keep in mind, my boyfriend is very sweet, he never yells at me.  I think I am getting upset for no reason but I just don't know why these things irritate me. This is what particularly annoyed me today. I normally make breakfast for two people, (him and I). But the breakfast today is something he usually makes that I don't know how to make. So I told him I'd start it for him but he'd have to finish it. In the mean time, I was packing lunch for him and I. We both had to go to work today mine is just a little later. I gave him the majority of the lunch I made because he asked for more. I turned around and I saw him packing whole overnight oats for himself for lunch. I told him, \"You asked for the majority of the lunch and you're also packing overnight oats for work?\" Keep in mind, I only had the lunch to eat, nothing else. While he was making breakfast, he asked if the dishwasher was clean which it was, and I told him not to worry about it because he was running late and I'd do it. But he did it anyway (which for some reason irritated me, i know stupid.) After breakfast, I saw that he only made a meal for one person, and he looked at me and said, \"oh you wanted some?\" That threw me off the edge. I blew up and was like, \"I also have a long day too, I have a final to take, which right after I have to go to work. I wanted to do the dishwasher so you would have time to eat and get to work early and I gave you the majority of the lunch I made, and you didn't even think to make breakfast for two?\" blah blah blah. He stayed quiet. but then told me I could have the one that was already made. I told him I didn't want to and for him to just eat it. He gave me it anyway, which irritated me even more. I know maybe to anyone else this sounds stupid and it probably is. I am asking for genuine advice so please don't answer with, \"yeah this is what my ex girlfriend was like.\" I feel bad already enough, but for some reason I just can't stop myself. \n\nI'm already on anxiety medication, and I go to therapy. I think I get upset because I have a set plan in my day and when he comes in a disrupts that plan it throws me off. I also might think its because we have been living together for a year and we spend a lot of time together. I don't know if its a space issue. Genuine advice would be great thank you.",

Atleast it’s traumatizing enough for me since I suffer with CPTSD, Anxiety disorder, Depression, and panic disorder.  Basically some guy was tailgating me the whole way and when I honked at him to slow the f down he stopped and put his window down.  I did the same thing and we had a very heated argument and I felt like rage was starting to take over.  We both left our car and squared up to each other (I was by myself and they were 3 that came out of the car).  I’m a local and he’s an expat from India.  We argued a bit more and I gotta admit I started swearing at him and belittling him (Which I’m not proud of but a part of me feels like he deserved it) while we were standing face to face because he started acting like a tough piece of shit.  My whole body was shaking because of my rage and I felt like I was so close to punching him but since they were 3 and I was by myself I decided not to get physical. And where I come from, the consequences are too big and they’re not worth it.  Plus I’m not the type of guy who goes out looking for fights.  I’m too old for this shit.  Eventually I took his license plate number as well as his phone number and told him to get the f out of my face so he left.  Right now, I feel so triggered and cant stop ruminating.  A part of me wishes that I had wiped the floor with him and taught him a lesson.  I’m still fuming and can’t calm down.  My physical symptoms are also at peak level and I feel like I’m dying.  I’m also starting to feel very depressed and I know this episode will last for weeks if not months. How do you cope in these situations and how can I calm myself down? I’m already in a very bad place in my life with regards to my mental health and I just don’t want to suffer even more because of this but I’m pretty sure it’ll last for a while now and I honestly can’t handle anymore suffering.

It didn't hit me until today that I'm not allowed to be upset at all around my wife.  I asked her about it, and she said she can't deal with my anger when I get mad. I can't even deal with it sometimes myself.  \n\nI just noticed that sometimes she resorts to name calling and she gets her feelings hurt when I retaliate back. Everyone comforts her and anytime I am mad.  I'm just throwing a mantrum.  After this observation. I was thinking \"Damn I have no spousal support.\"  I told my wife not to talk to me after this observation.  I left and went down the block to the gas station for a walk.  I'm munching on ice cream; I am starting to think these people don't actually care about me.  I'm just here as a money mule.  Which isn't much considering the job market suck in my area, and I have played with the idea of just moving where the work is since there isn't much going on here.  If people don't like it tough shit, I'm gone.  You either come or get left behind kind of thing.   It is driving fucking nuts not having a job, and rejection jobs, no jobs.  Everyone else has this stable job and the situation they want.  I just want to work and make my money too.  It is getting on my ever-last nerve!",

I boxed the garage door busting my knuckles open because the snow shovel only lasted a few swings. It was already raining so I can't drive the the roof of my car damaged.

I run down stairs and yep it's like a spillway on window busted because of the water. I just sat down on the steps to the basement. Watching the furniture float around. I didn't even bother rescuing anything. I took video for the insurance. Stood ankle deep in the sunroom snapping pictures. I sat there and had a beer.

I explained this to my fiance and they told me today that it really scared them. \nI really don't know what to do. My partner is supportive and wants me to get help.

But nope I decided to try sleeping it off. And then I got woken up and it happened.\n\nJust slamming doors right back and breaking a microwave on the floor. Idk what it is with me and glass but I always then to break something with glass. And it shatters in tiny pieces as small as dust and cleaning it up after wards is tiresome. After that I heard a knock on my door and it was my neighbor. I went out and yelled at the lady upstairs who had the door open. I then grabbed a brick and tossed it trying to hit the door but I missed. My neighbor trying to come me down but he just made it worse because after all, he was my ex and the trauma and flashbacks started to roll in. I pushed him and told him to F off. I yelled back at the lady “I don’t know what you husband did but you deserved it” hinted at the divorce my neighbor told me about.\n\nMaybe I know too much for my own good. But once cops were called I calmed down cuz I was thinking getting arrested yet again. But thankfully no charge was put.

    "title": "I'm the asshole in my own story and I don't know how to change",
    "selftext": "I'm like a weird, middle-class version of Joffrey from Game of Thrones or Homelander from The Boys. If you're not familiar with them, they're characters known for their cruelty and lack of empathy. The difference is, I wasn't raised to be this way. My parents did everything right, but somehow, I turned out like this.\n\n**My Family Background**:\n\nMy parents gave me everything they had. They always encouraged me to be kind and considerate, enrolling me in various activities and trying to teach me empathy. But even as a kid, I'd have these intense tantrums that went beyond normal childhood behavior. My mom is like a maid for the whole family, but I treat her like shit whenever I'm angry, not in the mood, or if something doesn't go my way. I go full Joffrey/Homelander mode, taking out my temper on them.\n\nI don't know how I got this way. My dad's a bit of a dictator, but that's tolerable. My mom does all the heavy lifting at home, which might be why I'm such a spoiled brat. Everything's been handed to me on a silver platter.\n\nI've tried digging into my family history. I have aunts and uncles who never forgive people for minor misunderstandings. I have this tendency too, but mine is probably way worse. My mom and dad never exhibited these traits, so I'm not sure if I just made myself grow into a piece of shit or if I've inherited some of those bad traits from elsewhere in the family tree.\n\nPart of my weirdness comes from choosing to stay home instead of socializing. This has warped my sense of morality and justice. Once I calm down from my outbursts, the damage is already done. I feel bad, but my family just brushes it off like it never happened.\n\nMaybe if I'd faced more challenges in life, dealt with difficult people, or juggled multiple responsibilities, I'd be different and probably know how to control my anger.\n\n**Realizing I'm the Problem: How My Behavior Affects Everything**\n\nI first realized how problematic my behavior was in high school. A friend called me out on my attitude, and it hit me hard. But even though I recognized the issue, I struggled to change. It's affected every aspect of my life. I've lost friends who couldn't handle my mood swings. At work, I'm known as the office hothead, which has definitely limited my career prospects.\n\nI've tried therapy and anger management, but I always quit after a few sessions. It's like I can't stand the idea of someone else telling me how to behave, even when I know I need the help.\n\n**Rage Quitting at Gaming**\n\nI used to rage hard at multiplayer FPS games. I'd scream, whine, and complain when I couldn't win. Once, I got so angry that I punched a hole in my wall. After years of this toxic behavior, I realized I wasn't happy anymore. I switched to single-player RPGs to avoid the rage.\n\nAs human beings, we should have more than one activity that brings us joy. Continually subjecting myself to anger and rage was destroying my well-being.\n\n**A Series of Relationship Disasters**\n\nI've had several girlfriends who all left me after seeing who I really am. My first girlfriend would always forgive me because \"I can't live without her.\" But once we got back together, I'd return to my old habits, never putting in effort and blaming her for our fights.\n\nI treated my ex girlfriends the same way I treat my parents. When something doesn't go my way, I go apeshit and treat them like shit. Then the cycle repeats.\n\nWhat's even more disturbing is my use of the silent treatment. Even when I've calmed down and know I should apologize, I can't bring myself to do it for days. There's a voice in my head telling me to make things right, but I just... won't. During these periods, I feel this constant tension in my chest, like a rubber band stretched to its limit.\n\nOne time, I gave my ex the silent treatment for a week because she forgot to buy my favorite snack at the grocery store. I knew it was ridiculous, but I couldn't stop myself. Eventually, I'd apologize, but it would be too late. We'd break up, and they'd find someone who treats them better. Any guy who doesn't treat them like shit is ten times better than me.\n\n**Self-Imposed Exile: Where I Am Now**\n\nBecause of who I am, I don’t have a deep connection with people, but that’s probably because when they know the real me, I start acting differently. My negative vibes, weirdness, and tendency to put people in uncomfortable situations have pushed everyone away. If they knew how I really am when I'm angry, they'd run away, unfriend me, and block me.\n\nThat's why I bought my own house and moved out of my family’s home so that they won’t have the trouble of dealing with me anymore. I only go out for necessities now, never really connecting with people anymore. It's a sad life, but I had to do it so my parents wouldn't have to deal with me.\n\nSometimes I still have tantrums and message my family, but I try to remind myself that everything here is my own fault. There's no one else to blame but me.\n\nNo one but my family and past relationships knows the full extent of who I am. Some people might have caught glimpses, but they haven't seen how truly angry I can get or what my tipping point really is.\n\nI'm terrified of what my future looks like if I can't get this under control. Will I end up completely alone? Will I ever be able to maintain a healthy relationship or advance in my career?\n\nI know I'm not all bad. I can be funny and creative when I'm in a good mood. I'm great with computers, and I've been told I'm a good cook, which is why I was able to buy a house too. But these positive traits get overshadowed by my temper and inability to handle frustration.\n\nI'm posting this because I don't know how to change. Has anyone else dealt with similar issues? How did you overcome them? I feel like I'm running out of options, and I'm scared of who I'll become if I can't fix this.",

    "selftext": "I have had to attend anger management sessions 3 times in my life. While in high school and twice as an adult. The thing is you can’t practice those “skills” until you’re actually angry. And usually all those sessions go out the window. Luckily I haven’t been to jail for snapping. I’m slow to get angry and for some reason ppl view me as a marshmallow and think I’m a pushover because of instead of standing up for myself I’ve ways did one of these walk away, cry or say absolutely nothing. I hate conflict because I don’t know what I’ll do if I get pushed to far. In my early 20s I caught my ex having sex in my car. I rammed my car into the car he was in. The girl jumped out screaming and he was apologizing trying to calm me down all while smelling like the other woman. The police was called after I left but no one press charges. I had a coworker that was annoyed by the attention I get from men. In my face she told me I don’t understand why they like her with a body like that. And this was on the regular she always felt the need to comment on my looks. We was in the middle of cleaning the salad bar. I grabbed a rail and threw it at her missed and while charging towards her my supervisor grabbed me and locked me in the fridge. Another time a customer called me the n word bc she thought I was lying about us being sold out of cake and I cursed her out. Each time I snapped it’s like another person was in control not me. I actually scared myself after snapping. Im super patient and nice. But once you take me there I’m afraid that I might finish it. Anyone else have this to happen them when they’re angry do you black out not remembering all the details  of what you did once angry and then feel horrified once your angry subside.",

There's nothing going on in my life that should cause something like this. I don't have abusive or alcoholic parents, I'm not very stressed out from school or work at the moment, and I haven't been diagnosed with anything anger related.\n\nI have an anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. I've had these since I was very young. I've read that this might cause some sort of anger, but I'm not sure. I went to therapy when I was young, mainly for these two issues, but also for my anger, which did very little for me. I see going back to therapy as a last resort because of my financial situation and how little it did for me as a kid. I've desperately tried things like meditation, working out, deep breaths, etc. To be honest, none of these things helped me keep calm or not break something. There's definitely better ways to express anger. My issue is that I get angry easily, and I won't feel satisfied until I break something.\n\nI feel bad for my family when they hear me breaking something, or when they have to interact with me when I'm angry. I've done a lot of looking on what I should do, but so far nothing I've tried has helped. I'm hoping someone on reddit has the answer on what I should do.",

I'm a son talking about his own father, I'm now in my 30s and it hasn't gotten better over time only much worse, why my mom decides not to leave I think is because she still works a couple years before retiring so she is simply too tired to deal with leaving or has just accepted being with someone like that. They do argue and get into fights often, he also gets into fight with my other brother, my sisters too but a bit less just because he gives them money because they are always in debt. I know this is personal information but I don't give a shit, he just makes me too angry, I try to get help for my own problems and so does my mom, but him he seemed to go once to get help then gave up thinking he is too good for that. He does also seem to think he is better than everyone. His mom did raise him kind of bad too like he couldn't do anything wrong, I think that's a big part of it because his brothers acted the same way. \n\nBecause of this I have a very hard time talking to other guys especially older guys.

Over the years I’ve learned coping mechanisms, I’ve gone to therapy, I’ve taken medication, but the anger is in me, and even though it’s gotten better, it comes out every so often. \n\nMy wife and I have been together for 10 years. Married for 5. In those 10 years, she has been the victim of my anger 3 times. The second time, I joined rageaholics anonymous and started a sobriety program. Until today I’d been sober for 9 months.

(Most baby’s are!) my wife is having a really hard time caring for him, and I’ve had to go back to work full time. I have a high pressure job, and am doing my best to balance work and home. \n\nUnfortunately my wife has started to get really harsh towards me. This has been a theme in our relationship, but has really amped up since we had our son. Her harshness comes across as annoyance with me, fighting when I try to help her, and maternal gate keeping.

My father in law took my son outside and my wife and him left. \n\nI’m not sure what happens next, but I’m heartbroken and I hate myself.

He's just gone back into hospital after coming out a few weeks ago from an emergency surgery to remove a large tumor; they discovered the cancer is all over the place.The same night his car got stolen (I live next door) I saw it happening because the revering lights came on, it was dark and obviously there's no reason for anyone to be using the car the owner is in hospital so I looked to see what was happening. Anyway, I sprinted out to try and gouge the c**ts eyes out (I really would have, I have no problem with the idea of killing scum) so he couldn't drive off but when I got to the car the doors were already locked and I couldn't get in. I got dragged into the road (barefoot) before I realised it was pointless losing my skin trying to get in. I would just get tossed to the floor down the road.\n\nI'm struggling to sleep. I keep playing it over in my head thinking what if what if what if what if. I could've grabbed a hammer and smashed the glass, I could've run straight for my bike and pursued. But realistically, I did what I could in the time I had. But I don't know how to deal with it. I'm so, so, so, angry and I'm terrified of them coming back to steal more and I won't get there in time AGAIN. Gave description to the police, but there's nothing on anpr and they pretty much closed the case within an hour of it happening which doesn't help with the anger. I've been given countless £100 tickets for absolute bullshit from those w*nkers, but when you need them to actually help you with something serious they don't fu*king try. I'm just so angry. I had to go and see my grandad in hospital today and tell him what happened. He looked so sad. I wanted to cry and I think he did too. He said how much he liked the car (high spec Jag F Pace, really lovely red stitch interior) and he was doubtful insurance would pay what it's worth. I held it together till I got back to my bike. I put my helmet on and just burst into tears in the middle of a busy lane in London it was so embarrassing. \n\nI'm very headstrong and physically capable. I internally pride myself on how good I am at helping others and knowing I can defend my own property, and that has been ripped away from me by a fucking locked door. I just want them to get what they deserve for doing to others and my grandad, and it's keeping me up thinking they never will.\n\nI had those fucking bastards 30cm away from my grasp and I was powerless to stop them. I hope they get everything they deserve sooner rather than later. I spent 2/3hours riding round trying to find the car with no luck. I honestly hope they die painfully for what they do. Will I ever get over this event? I feel so so sorry for my grandad, he's literally dying and this has happened to him. I hate thieves I fucking hate them. How do I process this and get a handle on my anger? It's really interfering with my life at this point.",

My mother has a schizophreniform disorder (finally diagnosed a few weeks ago) and when i was a child traumatized me with extreme outbursts of rage when i did something \"wrong\", made me her surrogate husband, seducing me, and required that i took part in her delusions. My father has always been a weak, passive man, slave to my mother, but at the same time he has bullied and verbally and physically abused me for most of my life. \n\nAfter a life of misery, spent unable to keep a job, hating myself, and fantasizing about suicide constantly, two years ago i decided to start therapy. \nI found an amazing therapist, specialized in developmental trauma caused by dysfunctional families. With her i've worked through a lot of the fear and negative introjections that made me unable to function in society. However, as the fear dissolved, my true self and will to live were not the only things that emerged...a life's worth of anger towards my parents and their abuse got free. \n\nI am currently trying to get a degree, and plan to leave this wretched household as soon as possible...Obviously, tho, my parents haven't changed...they still continue with the abuse, expecially my father. So, not only i have to work through and manage the rage planted in me when i was a child, but i continue to receive the same abuse that caused that anger. \n\nLately things are getting scary, the more i lose the fear towards my father, the more the rage grows, and i have homicidal thoughts towards him practically every second i am awake. I confronted him and his continuing abuse times and times again, we even had a physical confrontation recently, but he doesn't stop, he continues the bullying. \n\nMy therapist believes i am able to control and work through the rage from my childhood and to manage my father until my graduation, but i don't know...the need for vengeance is so damn strong, and this place so fucking insane...i fear one day i will actually loose my shit and kill them. I don't want that, i don't want to ruin my life for two psychotic assholes. \n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "So as a boy I always had anger issues. My mom blames it on my dad who also had really bad anger issues and he also wasnt really around much as a kid. Cheated on my mom a bunch and then kinda left us high and dry and whenever he would come around he was a huge asshole to me and we have always had issues ever since. I have come pretty close to throwing hands with my dad many times and a few times he pushed me around/held me down etc. I do have alot of anger towards him as he seemed to treat his new kids with his new wife much better, and overall showing he cared about them much more. Good example, as a 16 year old kid I chose to start playing guitar because thats what he does for a living. I wanted something to bond over. I asked for ine for christmas and he bought me a first act guitar from walmart. The same year he bought my 7 year old brother a brand new $2000 dollar dirtbike... and my 5 year old sister the same thing. So enough about dad, obviously alot of anger there, but then I joined the military right out of hs which was my life dream to be an airborne ranger... got most of the way through basic and fucked up my knee pretty bad and was released due to the injury reoccuring 2x throughout my childhood. It seems like ever since I was medically discharged I have just been a drunk asshole. Nothing ever seems to satisfy me and I just feel angry at everything all the time. Angry my wifes spending money frivolously, angry I cant seem to make enough to provide for my family, angry at inflation and all the greedy companies making it harder for us to survive, angry at rental owners for jacking up the rates. At times it feels like I just hate the fucking world and would be happy to see it all burn to the ground. I hate seeing rich kids that are given everything they want while I struggle to survive even with a decent career as a Medical Massage Therapist. Im just sick of being angry and I dont want to be the same dad to my kids that my father was to me but when Im constantly angry about everything its very difficult for me to handle their tempur tantrums etc. both of my kids have adhd and are very rambunctious so its tough for me to not get frustrated when they arent listening and are breaking things etc. I jnow this is long but ai wanted to just get all of this off my chest. I have wanted to change this forever and have tried coubseling to no avail, I studied yoga but that didnt solve it... I figured maybe somebody else out there might have some recommendations as to resources that worked for them. I.E. books or techniques. As someone who grew up doing martial arts and wrestling I always kind of used my anger to make me stronger and fight harder but now that Im not in a combative job like I wanted I feel like I have no outlet for it. I dont have the cash for martial arts classes and I dont have much extra time for the gym since I have my kids. All of my time goes to taking care of them, cooking, cleaning and working. Any help that is offered is greatly appreciated... Im at the end of my rope and just want to be happy  ",

    "title": "I wrote an essay about anger - why I suppressed it and how I'm reconnecting with it ",
    "selftext": "Anger \n\nGrowing up, I learned that one of the most useful emotions was  unacceptable: I internalized it was bad to be angry. Expressing it was punished with neglect or abuse from my childhood bullies or parents.\n\nAnd a punishment from the powerful (them) to the powerless (me) is unimaginably cruel.\n\nLike a weed plucked again and again and eventually removed by the root, I made my anger disappear. But when a magician makes something disappear, it doesn’t vanish - he just puts it in a pocket you can’t see. \n\n=\n\nI felt like you’re not supposed to feel anger, much less express it. If you do, there’s something wrong with you. This came from my immediate environment, but the broader culture carries the same sentiment.\n\nWhen people have anger issues, they need anger management classes. It’s curious that no other emotion gets this explicit treatment: Who has sadness issues? Where are the shame management classes? \n\nIt makes sense: Uncontrolled anger leads to starting bar fights and screaming at your wife. Uncontrolled sadness leads to video games in your mom’s basement. Anger poses a bigger threat to society. Because anger can become violence.\n\nBut we didn’t waste millions of years evolving anger. It’s an important feeling. \n\nAnger is a high-energy emotion. I recently went to a new coworking space and saw an acquaintance had left WhatsApp open, with a message that included my name - twice: *Good news, \\[my name\\] wasn’t there yesterday and I hope he doesn’t come back.*\n\nMy brain jumped into fifth gear. Anger rose, my brain condemned those two and my mind instantly imagined me revealing her for the awful person she was in a grand confrontation - in front of everyone, of course.\n\nAnger drives action. It’s like a security protocol on a military base: Close the doors, ready your weapons, be ready to shoot.\n\nAnger protects us. Well-expressed healthy anger enforces our boundaries. It’s our emotional body guard that protects us from attack. \n\nBut if you’ve learned to suppress anger, you’ll be like the magician vanishing something. You’ll put it elsewhere.\n\nMaybe you internalize it: You convert anger into depression. *“You can’t treat me like this”*, becomes *“I deserve to be treated like this”*.\n\nMaybe you bottle it up and let anger accumulate until it explodes. When people explode over small things, it’s because they didn’t express their annoyance the first 28 times it happened.\n\nAs Ava from bookbear express puts it:\n\n*\"We might describe ourselves as avoiding conflict, but I personally believe there is no such thing as avoiding conflict. There is only transmuting how you experience conflict.\"*\n\nIf you turn anger into depression, you’ll view yourself as less and have worse relationships because you can’t advocate for your needs. If you bottle it up, your outbursts will ruin relationships the other way around.\n\nBut if you’ve been taught that anger is unacceptable, you default to these options and never reach a healthy emotional state.\n\nSo we have to do what every rom-com wife asks her husband to do: Reconnect with feelings.\n\nRediscovering and then expressing a buried feeling is like using a shower you’ve never used before: First it’s terribly cold and nothing seems to change it, then it’s piping hot and it won’t get colder. Eventually, you understand the knobs and buttons and it gets easier to find a good middle ground.\n\nWhen you first express something you haven’t allowed yourself to feel, you’ll feel it more intensely than normal - often more intensely than appropriate. \n\nHow do you know whether you’re going too far? I’ve found a simple heuristic with anger: \n\n**Am I making my life better or making theirs worse?**\n\nAfter a month of dating, her communication changed over night, from flirty and cute to cold and short. From sending me pictures with her friends to “good, you?”. From “What would you say is your love language?” to day-long radio silence.\n\nShe ignored every question about what was going on. When she was finally honest and told me she didn’t feel emotionally available, we made plans to have lunch. But when I asked her to chat through this for 5 minutes so it’s not between us, the response was in past tense. *“You’re cool and it was so nice meeting you, I’ll say hi if I bump into you”.* \n\nThis made me angry: I deserve better than to end it over text,  to discard me because you’re too immature to talk for 5 minutes. It wasn’t that she was ending it (I had had my doubts too), but the way she treated me.\n\nI told her this and said it had made me angry. I don’t think I’ll get a response. \n\nBut my mind fantasizes of getting back at her - saying I wish she wouldn’t say hi if she bumps into me and please don’t text me again. Seeing her on a date and embarrassing her. And by the way, I feel sorry for the next guy you date.\n\nThis is where anger becomes violence. Me saying this changes nothing: She disrespected me and doesn’t care that she did. Our situationship is over and we won’t see each other again. \n\nIt’s just that a part of me wants her to feel what I felt: Hurt, pain, anger. But this is pointless. There’s no outcome here.\n\nIf I bump into her, it’s easy enough to ignore her. I probably won’t see this woman again, even without telling her. \n\nIf I told her this, I wouldn’t make things better for me, just  worse for her. \n\nIf anger is your security protocol, make sure that protocol isn’t mutually assured destruction.

I can't help but hold onto all  anger I have build up inside of me, it feels like it's slowly killing me.\n\nI never realized until years later how much crap from I put up with from everyone and how much gas lighting I fell for. So many years in school I'll never get back because I was bullied by assholes and never fought back and even stood up for myself. Why? Because I was taught to not fight back and to always tell a teacher. And the few times I did fight back, even when I was defending myself or I was just getting picked on I was punished by the school and by my mom for causing trouble. So for most of my time in school all I ever knew is how to be a victim and never stand up for myself. \n\nIt doesn't help that I couldn't socialize with other students, partly because I always came to school smelling like a chimney because my mom loved to smoke in the house. And partly because I couldn't do any after school activities that I wanted to do because my mom wouldn't let do any sports or hang out with friends. BUT NO!!! My mom isn't the problem, I AM, I'M ALWAYS THE PROBLEM. Everyone just says my mom is a \"oh so hard working single mother who's trying her best, and she can do no wrong\" \n\nAnd all the physical and verbal abuse I've dealt with from people not only from school but day to day life. I always think about it, at least every hour. I think \"what if I actually stood up for myself, what if I actually beat the shit out of the guy who called me retarded and pushed me in school instead of telling the teacher who didn't even do anything about it. What if I stabbed the guy with the screw driver I had in my pocket while he was calling me a good for nothing piece of shit at my job. What if I smacked the bitch who tried to fight me on the bus because I politely asked her to put out her cigarette.\" I think about all these things and many more everyday and my fantasies are becomin more and more violent. Why? Because in all of these scenarios I always thought I was taking the \"high road\" and being the bigger person when in fact I was letting everyone walk all over me, and letting them know they could get away with it. \n\nI wasted five years of my life at some stupid fucking job where I had to deal with asshole managers didn't give a shit about me and always verbally harassed me even when I was doing my job right. Not to mention the asshole customers who would come in and start talking shit and causing problems and I had to just take it all. I couldn't say anything back or else I'd be in the wrong. \n\nThat's the worst part of it all, everyone got away with it. And don't give me that \" Oh, what goes around comes around. Karma with get them in the end\" bull crap. Because it never does and it's not real. They got away with how they treated me, and whenever I bring it up people tell me \"You're so immature, you're holding onto things from the past, just let it go and move on no one else is thinking about thise things except you\" WHY SHOULD I LET IT GO? No seriously tell me why, tell me why I should forget all the crap people gave me? It sounds like it be more convenient for them if I just forget it. \n\n Everyday that I wake up it feels like life just wants to piss me off, my mom that always has something to complain about or to verbally abuse me and I can't say anything back to her. The only \"friends\" I have treat me like I'm the \"Meg\" and constantly shit on me as a joke. While I do have a better job than I had before I still have to deal with asshole customers who think my job is to serve them and tell them they're right. I can't even open my phone without seeing \"Men are depressed and no none carew, Men aren't shit, Women aren't shit,  Our world is doomed, You're life is shit and it's all you're fault, E girl makes millions of dollars selling her nudes and shit on everyone, New asshole influencer shows off how much better there life is but still acts like victim, politics, politics FUCKING POLITICS EVERYWHERE AND IN EVEYTHING!!! \n\nAll this anger has taken my mind and body where I can't go a day without being angry even if I haven't done anything or spoken to anyone all day. All I can think about is taking my anger out on somebody or anybody, maybe even multiple people. All I want to do I cause someone pain. I know it's wrong, and I don't want to think this way but at this point I'm caring less and less. It feels like now I'm just waiting for the right person to piss me off, to give me a reason so I can unleash everything in my being and beat them to death. I've even been thinking about buying a gun or knife, it wouldn't be hard, I have no history of violence and or anything that would stop me. I really don't want to, but I feel like if I don't my I'm going to continue to take my anger out on myself and it's gonna kill me instead. Not that anyone would even care.\n\nIt feels like I'm not even allowed to be angry, like I'm not allowed to vent my anger, even though everyone else around me vents there anger out on me. People will say \"well don't be angry, just be greatful you're even alive. You're problem is your personality, if you change your tune you'll be happier\" WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN TELL ME HOW TO FEEL? WHY DO I NEED TO CHANGE FOR ANYONE ELSE? WHY CAN'T OTHER PEOPLE WORK ON THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF PREACHING TO ME THAT I NEED IMPROVE? \n\nI really just needed to get this out of my system. Idk if I'm going to even keep this up. I just hope that someone understands what I'm going through.",

My father saw these problematic signs and had to drill certain ideals into me, like \"Never act in anger\" and to \"just walk away\". He must have been successful, because to this day, I have never struck someone intentionally.\n\nAfter high school, I felt a surge of peace and empowerment, like everything was good and I was happy, but when I moved out of the house and started living on my own, that feeling was completely destroyed. The world is not an easy place to live in; it is expensive, it is unfair and it is cruel.\n\nI was always an observer of others, but now, all I felt I could do was powerlessly exist as I watched the lives of others go by. While watching time pass, day by day, the anger I'd buried for so long had begun to seep through the floor in my mind, festering and bubbling up, forming a toxic pool, and every day, it would deeper and deeper, until I'm gasping for air, soon overtaken by the sludge.\n\nI don't know how long it's been since I've felt like this anymore, but my best guess is at least 5 years. Mild annoyances for a normal person make me imagine melting the world away, like in Terminator 2, when Skynet nukes Humanity. I am proud to say that I have still never intentionally struck another person (an unintentional example would be fake sword fighting and accidentally nailing my friend in the fingers with my fake sword), but my fantasies are becoming worse and worse.\n\nI truly believe that life has no inherent value and that our time breathing on this Earth serves no other purpose than to keep breathing until we're no longer able. I truly believe that people are selfish beings that are only generous as long as it is convenient. I truly hate today and I truly hate the world.\n\nWhen I observe people now, all I can do is imagine immeasurable violence. I am overcome by the feeling to destroy and, in turn, be destroyed. I know that nobody deserves what I imagine doing, but I imagine it all the same and I cannot help it.\n\nI have accepted that people are capable of terrible things, but I fear that I may be the worst type of person that can exist. I am keeping it under wraps and I am in control, but I am excited for the day, if it ever happens, that I am not. I know how sick that is, but nothing makes me smile wider. But I keep myself in check by telling myself that I do not exist and that someone who does not exist has no right to subject real people to their will.\n\nI just worry that it's not so much an IF I'll ever become violent, but WHEN it will happen. I crave it and the thought sets my teeth on an appetizing edge. I really do wish that I could end the world and all life. I hate the idea of suicide and somehow, I love the idea of everything, not just me, returning to nothing. All life gone. Nothing left. Eradicated.\n\nWho knows?

    "title": "These thought patterns could be making you angrier",
    "selftext": "Maybe you find yourself getting very angry with people, too angry, and you'd like to know how you can tone it down. Based on some research from Dr. Martin and Dr. Dahlen (2011), they identified thought patterns that are very common in people with anger problems and compared those thought patterns to people without anger problems.\n\nThey identified 5 types of thoughts that are common amongst the chronically/overly angry.\n\n* Demandingness\n* Catastrophizing\n* Overgeneralizing\n* Misattributing Causation\n* Inflammatory Labeling\n\nDemandingness is pretty straight forward. And you can recognize it when you think start thinking about how people should behave or how they ought to think. Demandingness is when you have high expectations for other people or situations, and this leads to more anger when your expectations aren't met. Your angry brain may put expectations on people that are contradictory or very hypocritical. You can start to tone this down by switching to preference based thinking. Some demands are *good*, people should not resort to violence or intentionally hurt people. But thinking in a demanding way, will ramp up your anger.\n\nCatastrophizing is when you are thinking \"this is the worst\", \"I'll never recover from this\", or \"it's totally ruined now\". Catastrophizing about situations can be angrier and a good antidote to this is to practice sticking to the facts as much as possible. Some situations *are* catastrophic. A family member dies, you have a heart attack and desperately need to make health changes. But blowing things out of proportion when it's not warranted can blow your anger out of proportion to the situation too.\n\nOvergeneralizing can be seen in key words like \"always\" or \"every\", \"everybody\" or \"nobody\". If you have an anger issue you may do this with yourself a lot \"I always get out of control angry\" or with other people \"they never care about my feelings\". When something is repeatedly happening, it would be wise to understand that it's happening frequently. But people and situations are often more complicated than something happening always or never.\n\nMisattributing Causation is when you think somebody or something is the cause of something, but you're wrong. You get home, your keys are misplaced, and you say \"Why did my wife move my keys? I hate it when she does that. Doesn't she know I have a place for them?\" but then you call her and she explains to you \"I was looking for your keys too, and they weren't in the usual spot\". You go look around and find you never took your keys out of your pocket last night. It's too late and now you're annoyed over what you thought happened rather than what actually happened. Had you paused to consider that you might be wrong (this takes a lot of practice), then you could've calmed down at the start. This is a good reminder that events don't make us angry, our thoughts about events make us angry. \n\nInflammatory Labeling is when you think or say \"wow that person is such an idiot\" or \"that fucking asshole is so mean\". As soon as you label someone negatively like that, it becomes much harder to view that person as anything other than how you've labelled them. For me this one has been very hard on myself, when I've given myself really harsh labels. That has ramped up my anger with myself and made it very hard to see situations clearly or deal with anger with myself in a productive way. For people I don't like or people acting in a way I think is really unfair, it's helped my angry brain justify being mean in a way that I can never justify after the fact.\n\nHere is an image from Dr. Ryan Martin's book *Why We Get Mad: How to Use Your Anger for Positive Change*. It compares the angriest people to those who rarely get angry. You can see high levels of demandingness is most common amongst people with anger problems but inflammatory labeling is a better predictor of anger problems because people who rarely get angry don't often have that thought pattern.\n\n[5 Angry Thought Patterns](https://i.imgur.com/prSzRag.png)\n\n\nPracticing reducing these thought patterns has helped me a lot. And I can notice my anger is easier to tone down. Practice and I know you will see a difference in your life. Good luck my angry friends.",

Maybe it's because we were in the car that I couldn't control it anymore, but I started punching and slapping my face and legs... Crying profusely. I don't really remember doing it I just remember him pulling over and trying to calm me down. I screamed \"okay! Okay!\" Like his anger and words towards me were confirmed with my own self loathing abuse... I hyperventilated a bit.... But then felt so embarrassed.. I'd look down at red legs and face turning into bruises.... Like this has been a somewhat normal secret of mine for years but now my husband's seen it... I look crazy. The woman in the car next took us looked over like I was crazy. I look like a bratty girl who has had an immature fit when she doesn't get her way. \n\n... After he calmed me down, he felt really guilty and I felt bad for making him worry... I started to feel better but I developed a headache... This was followed by a week of non stop dizziness and throwing up. NON STOP. My world just never ever stopped feeling like I had just jumped off the swings. I went to the emergency unit and was diagnosed with vertigo, which I really truly believe was brought on by trauma to my head....\n\nIf you've had the same issues don't hit/slap yourself in the head/face it could cause permanent damage or even a stroke!! \n\nI'm starting to feel better, trying my best to manage my vertigo which was pretty severe. But I do worry about the future and how I'm going to control not hitting my head and face anymore when I feel like I'm losing myself in the moment...\n\nI'm not sure how to work on this... Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

It gets rid of my willingness to fight, and gives me some space to apply the other techniques.\n\n**Focus meditation** - one thing thats sometimes not said about meditation/mindfulness is that its extremely messy, and it can backfire in a way that it lets you sit with the story that makes you angry, and develop it in your head. A focused meditation can be tro try to breath to a metronome or a watch, or sometimes i draw my breaths in/out with a pen while doing it. \"Walking meditation\" is a thing and you can look up that too. \n\n**Active listening** - if i'm in a meeting or something, i sometimes try to write down exactly what people are saying, to make sure i'm focused on whats going on and not the story i'm telling myself about what is going on.\n\n**Examining my own needs** - sometimes we sit with a strong feeling of restlessness and discomfort, without really being able to break it down to actionable change. It can help sometimes to just walk through a [list of basic human needs](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory) and try and think what i am missing in my life at the moment.\n\n**Self Compassion** - It's really easy for me to get angry at myself when i mess up, at work, or in my personal life. Trying to connect the things i'm struggling with to what other people might struggle with sometimes help dissolving this, or at least ease it a bit. Note that this is something that takes a bit of practice, there's a [bit of material to be found here](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#exercises)\n\n**Examining the story in my head** - Lots of times my anger directed at another person comes from the story that i'm telling myself about what is going on. This often leads to spiralling thoughts for me where i create this rant in my head about how lazy and selfish other people are. \n\nWell i try to keep it short, i hope this helps some of you find some new ways that might work for you. Also i would love to hear from you what has worked for you, i always need more tips.\n\nThank you for reading!",

It makes you numb, and that makes it easier to act.\n\n2. Anger comes from an inability to admit that no action can ever make up for another action. Denial, in other words. It comes from an inability to admit that you were victimised, at no fault of your own, and that there really is nothing you can do that will make up for it in the end. This is the single most difficult pill for an angry person to swallow.\n\n3. The only person who can defuse an angry person, is the angry person themselves. They must accept everything laid out in point 2. This allows the anger to dissipate, allowing them to access their feelings directly and process them in a healthy way.\n\nThat’s my take. Easier said than done, especially as we have plenty of angry role models in the world telling us otherwise, but that’s the general impression I have.",

You and your beautiful soul have been hurt along the way and I am so truly sorry for that, you didn't deserve it. Unfortunately, It is in human nature to make mistakes but remember there are no mistakes in nature.\n\n\nBreathe, this is the worst part.\n\n\nI am proud of you. I am proud of you for every mistake or misstep that you feel you may have made that has brought you here, exactly where you are supposed to be and while you may be in tremendous pain or lost and feeling misunderstood know that you are always loved. Situations, life, they change. (Wu-Tang is forever)\n\n\nPlease know that you are never alone and just because you feel or may have been labeled 'different' doesn't mean that your feelings or life are invalid, quite the opposite. I believe, as do other cultures around the world that what makes you different enough to be singled out is what makes you special and that is precisely what makes you so very important. \n\n\nI am proud of you and I love you, unconditionally, for everything that makes you, You. \n\n\nThe power of being able to say that to yourself in the mirror till you believe it (and it's not easy but you wouldn't be tasked with this burden if you could not handle it) is something that I believe every soul on this planet needs. If this helps, keep the ball in play and pass it along. Wall Street is one thing, the miracle that is You and changing the societal habit of labeling and ostracizing without helping is another. Void, a place where some of us exist, has now shown itself to be vortex, gathering power. \n\n\nI believe this message begins here, with you. You, the one tuned to a different frequency, the one that can feel everything because it is you that is brave enough to accept this message because you feel it in your heart. A heart that has been to the deepest of disconsolate depths, a heart with unlimited capacity, and that heart knows that I mean every word that I have written because you know it was written to and for you. \n\n\nWe are all we have and we desperately need you and I promise you, My Dear One that's reading this, it's going to be ok. \n\n\nI happen to know that you are here to change the world. \n\n\n~Love, The Universe by way of Someone That Fucking Believes In You\n\n 🤍∞",

That all being stated, I'm trying to figure out where my annoyance with everyone comes from. I've always been this way it feels like, but I guess I'm tired of trying to avoid it as an issue.\n\nI was at a public meeting for work recently and noticed that while everyone was mingling with each other and in generally good spirits, for seemingly no good reason at all, I felt annoyed with these people. None of them had done more than say hello to me, but just seeing the smiles on their face was upsetting. \"How stupid is this all?\" and \"I really don't want to be here\" type statements kept crossing my mind. Given I was on the ass end of a 12-hour work day, it doesn't take much from people to get me to this state of mind. Literally just existing around me is enough to trigger my annoyance. I'm tired of being the asshole, but its who I am.\n\nMy day-to-day at work consists of being around many high-energy people who, you guessed it, annoy me to high hell. It begins to fester in the morning and by the time I'm ready to leave I cannot stand the people in my office for another second. And they really don't do anything that should warrant my annoyance. As I stated, I have a good career that pays the bills and then some, but is ultimately unfulfilling. I feel like my anger with these people is a large contributor to it feeling unfulfilling. I get in this downward negative spiral of thoughts once the annoyance begins and end up in a place where I'm thinking that this job sucks and I'm killing my time here.\n\nIts getting to the point to where I'm having trouble enjoying anything unless its stimulates me. I can't just sit and be somewhere that most people would at least be neutral in. I feel like a spoiled child who throws tantrums when they aren't where they want to be, but instead of kicking and screaming its deeply negative internal thoughts.\n\nThere's more, but I think this generally sums up the anger I'm dealing with.

    "selftext": "This is long, sad, and kind of meandering.  You've been warned.\n \nI've been happily married to my wife for a couple years now (we've been together for 9) and have a 1 year old son.  Having a toddler in the house is....challenging.  I don't want to blame my anger on him.  He doesn't deserve that.  He's a goddamn baby.  My wife doesn't deserve it either.  She's trying her best.  She's the sweetest, most gentle person I've ever met.\n\n  I grew up with separated parents and between my dad being mostly absent, my mom being somewhat verbally abusive, and getting bullied at school, I think I may have some mental scar tissue that never really healed right.  I never got help and kind of attributed it to \"teen angst.\"  But when I do some soul searching on why I lose my goddamn mind sometimes, it all comes back to those shitty memories.  My point is I don't want to make my son go through all that.  I want to be a good role model and an even better father.  But my meltdowns aren't exactly helping.\n\nThe outbursts are few and far between.  I can go months without an episode.  And I've never, EVER, laid a hand on anyone in anger.  But when it happens, I see red.  I start screaming and hyperventilating, swearing and smashing whatever inanimate object is nearby.  It always seems to be a \"straw the broke the camel's back\" moment, one little spark that ignites the powderkeg.  Or the slowly boiled frog metaphor.  By the time I realize what's happening, I'm already WAY past the point of catching myself.  I'm a big guy too, tall and muscular.  I'm sure I'm quite scary when I get angry.\n  \nOne outburst happened this evening.  I was chopping vegetables for dinner and got distracted by my wife and kid in the kitchen.  Sliced my thumb open, blood everywhere.  Instead of just cleaning up and putting on a band aid like a normal person, I started screaming and punching the nearest cabinet.  I think I blacked out for a few seconds.  By the time I caught my breath, my wife was HIDING in the basement with my son.  It broke me.  That's when the low usually comes, after I witness the results of my tirade.  I get quiet, depressive, nauseous...it's like crashing after drinking a lot of caffeine.\n\nAfter our son was in bed, I tried to talk to my wife about what happened.  And by \"talk,\" I mean \"blaming my wife for ME being clumsy with a knife.\"  She starts crying, goes out to her car.  Wow, good job, me.  Really fucked that one up, huh.  She came back in after 30 minutes and I apologized, begged her to talk to me.  She just wants to go to bed, but tells me to look up Intermittent Explosive Disorder and shuts the door. \n\nI'm at a loss.  I'm too embarrassed to talk to any of my friends or family.  It's pathetic.  A 31 year old man with a great career and even greater family and I can't even talk about my feelings with anyone.  After reading about IED, I think some of the symptoms and patterns of my outbursts match the condition.  But come on.  I'm not gonna WebMD my way out of this one.  I have a REAL condition and need a REAL solution.\n\nTo those who read that all, thanks.  I'm not even sure what my question is, or the specific point of this post.  All I know is I need to change.",

(i'm partially joking here but i'm sure someone is gonna appreciate it).\n\nTldr: Struggled with anger in my life, lost jobs, hurt people, I don't like it. Im near my lowest right now but, these last 4 days ive been really calm and felt like talking about my life and anger statistics a bit. Knowing how wide the problem is spread makes me feel less like the odd one out for having rage at the wrong times and getting unlucky.\n\n\\-This is not meant to be a rant, but I do want to share some life context, I rarely open up so sorry this might be a little wordy because of build up. I do want to speak about my life in a more story format as I dont feel like saying \"I get angry a lot\" gives off how deep it feels to me.\n\nYou can skip to the statistic discussion.\n\nSince childhood, I've been locked in a battle with anger. At school, I was the target of constant teasing, igniting a fire of rage within me that grew over time (started as the quiet student). This anger shadowed my adolescence, blocking any chance of fitting in or forming meaningful friendships (I never got into open forgiveness, I could forgive people in my heart but one cross on me was friendship ending. I hated how easy people betray and belittle you, im not saying im right, but this is how it was). Entering adulthood didn't ease the struggle; juggling life's pressures often resulted in slammed doors, punched walls, and broken relationships. (college bills, my first relationship had an aweful ending (probably a story for a different sub but to avoid rant - I set boundary about guys because I feel uncomfortable (my family is full of infidelity and I cant stand it, I tried to have a respectful boundary where you can have male friends but just not constantly put yourself in alone 1 on 1 situations with them for no reason) - she ignored it (a friend of hers with guilty mind alerted me to a situation) - I gave another chance because she begged (and at the time I didnt think she actually cheated, I was naive) - one day from the corner of my eye I see the dudes name on  her phone - she refuse to explain, I blew up, broke some things (ive avoided ever physically hitting another human so far in my life somehow) and had to change colleges.\n\nEmployment became a series of false starts. Each new job began with hope but quickly deteriorated into frustration and rage, leading to an inevitable exit. This destructive cycle continued until I found myself unemployed for two long months. It wasn't just the financial strain that weighed on me—it was the painful realization that I was sabotaging myself. My uncontrolled anger was destroying everything I was and everything I wanted to be. Even in high school I was still hopeful for the future, but even after escaping my hell hole small town I keep running into people that seem to do everything in their power to blow me up (im aware parts of it are totally my fault but im the one telling the story here).\n\nBut then, a new job offered a ray of hope amidst the chaos I had created. It wasn't an instant cure, but it sparked a desire to better understand and manage my anger. The job basically has an aspect of it where it is almost my job to get angry for the sake of others. Being in that position however exposed me to my coworkers complaining about their own problems and the problems they are trying to solve for our clients. Something was just starting to click when hearing them speak almost sounded like hearing the voice in my own head speak. However non of them seem to have had (or are willing to admit) anger related problems. I guess some people just hide it up better and im unluckily not one of them. I started wondering just how common is anger, am I really just so shitty as a person that I'm labeled or am I just putting too much emphasis on this aspect of my life?\n\nThis obviously hasn't rewritten my past, but reading the statistics might be helping reshape my future (as far as how I see my outbursts).\n\n## PERSONAL STORY ENDED HERE, NOW FOR THE ANGER STATISTICS\n\nEdit: Source for the statistics can be found here on [Luxwisp](https://www.luxwisp.com/anger-statistics/) . They link sources so it is easy to find direct studies and methods of collection.\n\n\\------\n\nFor the longest time, I've felt like my anger placed me on the fringes, like I was walking a solitary path defined by my rage. I've been that guy—fists clenched, yelling at nothing, driving everyone away.\n\nToday, I stumbled upon a slew of stats that made me feel less alone in anger. Nearly 80% of drivers have been pissed behind the wheel. I mean, that's almost every damn person driving beside you. And it’s not just some mild irritation; we're talking real rage—tailgating, screaming, honking, being the classic road dick. I always felt like movies and media shame the angry driver character so much because they were being full society deviant (or being me just about 30 days in a year).\n\nEight million drivers are out there with fists ready, getting confrontational over a patch of asphalt. I'm angry, sure, but I've never rammed my car into someone's. Yet, apparently, a solid 3% have (5.7 million). And I thought I had issues.\n\nLet me take a breath here. Because while this paints a picture of a society simmering with anger, knowing I'm part of a bigger picture eases my tension, just a bit.\n\nI've been the tailgater, shouting curses in a metal box, feeling my blood boil over a stranger's CUTTING ME OFF... oh wait this isnt a rant, back to earth. The numbers say that 51% have tailgated on purpose. That's half the driving population driving someone off the road with their anger. And 47% yelling? Sounds about right.\n\nMy latest meltdown? Two months without a job, left with nothing but a mirror and the angry man staring back at it. I was almost comforted to learn that 7.8% of US adults are wrestling with fierce anger. It sucks but we are not alone.\n\nThat calm tone coming out now? That's resignation. Young people are steaming with anger too—over 22% of them. I'm early 30s but something about knowing the next gen think they have it worse makes me feel like im way ahead of them.\n\nSubstance abuse haunts 43% of us with anger issues. I have struggled with this myself but I always sort of assumed that was a semi unique part of my struggle. Im not saying to not get help, nor am I saying anything about cause or correlation.\n\nTaking another calming breath here...\n\nLooking back, I can't even say I'm surprised that nearly 45% of people with anger like mine faced some sort of verbal abuse or emotional neglect when they were young. Isn't it ironic how past pain shapes us?\n\nAmericans, 84% of us (or \"them\" if you are outside), think we're all getting angrier. Watching the news is like throwing gasoline on the fire for 29% of people. I mean, we could have all guessed that (id have guessed even more, how often do I ever see comments on news articles that are not just people venting?)\n\nSitting here now, writing this, the anger rises and falls like the tide—a force of nature that's neither good nor bad on its own. But it's something many of us share, to some degree. I got a job again, a spot of hope in a sea of red mist, and maybe it's time to steer this ship through calmer waters. The stats reminded me I'm not alone. And knowing that, for whatever reason, takes some of the burn out of the fire.\n\nIf you're reading this, feeling like you're about to boil over, take a second. Look at these numbers. We're a legion, and it's time we acknowledge the beast we’re facing—within us and across society. Maybe then, we can start taming it, together.\n\nI started therapy, im not well versed enough to detail it by the jargon but I do feel like it started to help me a bit. I am still having minimal interation with most people as people are the general cause of my anger. Somehow im hopeful that in the future I can reduce the outbursts where I later down the line regret. I can't really see a world where I would never be getting mad, and that is alright, the stats show it isnt uncommon. Why do so much of us feel we need to be 100% calm in order to think we solved our problems?\n\nI hope this look helps at least one person a little. I sort of said way more than I originally intended but hopefully a little discussion forms? Ive never been good with social media so even pouring out this much about myself feels extremely vulnerable. Anger issues isnt exactly something most of us would ever want to admit outwardly.",

When I react calmly to a situation - even one where my wife is initially reacting angrily, everyone gets calmer.  The kids stop yelling, my wife stops yelling.  I'm just saying this because I know that working on anger can at times feel thankless and rewardless -- you manage to control yourself, and you feel like you get shit on and you don't get the \"gratification\" of the angry outburst/release.\n\nYet I realized that the gratification of seeing my family calmer and happier is the reward, and it's way, way better than any release I could get from blowing up.  We all model behavior for each other.  When the kids fight they're imitating us. When I raise the room temperature by yelling, my wife is going to be influenced by it, just like I am when she does it.

Revenge, Hate and so on pops up and makes me say things I always regret afterwards.\n\nThe thing it worked for me and cause me a REAL turning point is being seeing myself possessed by anger. I asked permission to my wife to install cameras at home around the areas where we spend most of the time together, where higher chances we have to interact and eventually discuss about anything. \n\nI must say initially I was controlling myself somehow because I was aware of it, so when there're triggers... they went away. However as any Big Brother, you eventually forget about the cameras recording and after a few days, we have a tough discussion with my Mr. Hyde showing up. I completely forget about anything around me as it happens to all of us.\n\nThe day after my wife wanted me to watch the video, but I didn't want to. She somehow and kindly encouraged me to do so, and I couldn't recognise myself. My eyes fully open, yelling, quick and rapid movements, completely out of control... I still can't recognise myself.\n\nSince then, that image is inside me tormenting me. Can't believe I turned to that disgusting evil. But it is the ONLY thing I've ever tried in my life that actually it's been a change. It's been 20 years with anger issues, young people. I know what I'm talking about.\n\nBefore leaving this group which I don't find it necessary anymore, I just want to say thank you and I really hope you find your way out of this destructive behaviour which eventually hurt oneself: grief, resentment, upper back pain, wrinkles, hair whitening and solitude is what anger gives you back. No solutions. \n\nAll the best and goodbye",

Just anything to calm me down. Because I've learnt over the years how to do this.\n\nRecently I went through a horrible depression patch. I tried to kill myself, and ended up in a bad way.

So much so that I wanted to share it with you folks in case it helps anyone else.\n\n>\"Because we assume responsibility for every action \\[of our child\\], then when they don’t behave in a way that is appropriate or okay… this triggers us to regain control. **Their bad choice is our bad choice.**\"  \n>  \n>\"So now, **I’m trying to control you so that I can calm down.**\"  \n>  \n>\"You are so triggered by the disrespect, because **when you were a child, there was no room for disrespect**\"  \n>  \n>\"If i'm not really strict, this means I'm not in charge and my \\[child\\] is not going to take me seriously. **Being in charge is not the same as controlling other people.** When you think of being in charge as controlling those in front of you, this comes from a place of powerlessness. **I need to control because I'm out of control.** Being in charge is being in charge of yourself.\"\n\nI have anger problems, that's why I'm in this subreddit. A lot of my anger I justify by saying someone else caused it. However, these quotes really struck home.\n\n**Their bad choice is our bad choice** \\- I'm completely guilty of this. The majority of my anger at people is that I feel like I'm the reason they made the mistake. I'm mad because I take ownership of their mistake, and that means I'm taking ownership of FIXING that mistake. If someone hits my car, I feel like it's my fault somehow... and if I yell at them enough, they can learn to not hit me again. Obviously, that doesn't go through my head at the time, but really, what other reason is there to yell at them? They hit me... I can't do anything now. My car is damaged.  Yelling at them solves nothing, unless I'm trying to change the behavior of someone I hopefully never see again.\n\n**I’m trying to control you so that I can calm down.** \\- Again, I'm VERY guilty of this, and it relates to the above. If something is out of my control (child broke a toy, wife forgot to do something I asked her to do), I get mad. I'm mad because you didn't do something I told you to do. I'm mad because **I can't control the situation.** I get mad at the person so that I can regain control, then I can calm down. But really.. I almost never calm down after this... I just keep escalating if I can't control the flow of the argument.\n\n**When you were a child, there was no room for disrespect** \\- Yeah, I think a lot of us relate here. When I did anything remotely disrespectful, I was punched, burned, hit, starved, and a variety of other punishments. Disrespect is such a huge trigger for me. HOW DARE YOU NOT TREAT ME AS A... dictator? I mean really... we can't control how people treat is. If a girl I like doesn't like me... what is there for me to do except move on? If I don't get a job... I can be disappointed, but it doesn't make sense to get mad. If the roles were reversed, you're not going to like every person that hit on you or give any random person a job.\n\n**I need to control because I'm out of control.** \\- This is 100% true of me. When I feel like things are spiraling out of control (house is dirty, behind on projects at work, behind on bills), I find myself getting more irritable and angry. I get mad at those around me when they do something I don't like, to a disproportionate degree. I NEED to yell at someone because I can't control my life, so I want to control that person.\n\nHonestly, I'm writing this out for myself. I don't like being an angry person. And I hate myself even more when I learn to control my anger for months... only for it to come back in full force. I don't have the answer, but running away from my problem won't help either. Hopefully, my self reflection helps someone else on their path of anger management too.",

It would range from getting riled up at the prospect of little things (such as random nerds on the internet) to bigger things (such as becoming homeless). My anger got to the point where it was out of control and I was afraid I would hurt someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, I was eating lunch as usual, with thoughts of the next person who I wanted to smash lingering in my head. All of a sudden, I felt like I was about to faint and my heart fluttered. I couldn't feel my face and the left side of my neck hurt and felt stiff. I thought it was a heart attack. The doctor ended up telling me I had an anxiety attack due to severe stress. It was at that moment I realized I had a problem. I needed to calm down. I really searched for a root cause but realized it was my addiction to getting angry and getting in random fights with people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has been nearly a year now since I had that panic attack and not once this entire year have I had any anger towards someone. I am uncharacteristically calm and people in my life are VERY confused. Many people tell me I'm not my usual self; as if they're speaking with someone completely new. To be honest, they are. I have been reborn. A couple days ago, someone lost their shit at me and told me they would kill me/ruin my life etc. I was able to just calmly let him finish his rant and tell him everything was OK. I felt so in control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese were the steps I took to calming down:\n\n* Drink chamomile tea. The tea itself contains apigenin which binds to receptors in your brain that calm you down. Drinking it daily can train your mind to calm down. Sort of like exercise for the receptors in your brain.\n* Didn't touch my phone unless I needed to call or text someone. I went from using my phone literally the entire day to using it maybe once a day. It made me realize just how disconnected I really am from friends and how little I see them. It also made me appreciate what was going on around me and gave my mind a rest.\n* I did things that made me happy. I began watching a show that I loved as a child named Dragon Ball Z. The innocence of that show rubbed off on me and made me feel happy. The world doesn't seem so dark anymore because Akira Toriyama (the animator) makes his nature drawings really bring out the beauty and colour of the world.\n* I began running. I used to lift heavy weights all the time (which may have contributed to my anger issues as I was very much used to the strain on my heart/body). I barely lift weights anymore. Running has made me feel a lot more at peace with the world. It made me realize I didn't have to be big and beefy to survive. I just have to be happy.\n* I realized it's OK not to fight. I used to not allow anyone to cross me and anyone who did, would be dealt with. After a while, it got tiring but I kept it on because I thought if I didn't, I would not survive. I realized the majority of people are not worth any energy and for the most part are all talk. I was right. \n* I began making friends. This was not really contributing to 'the cure' but more a result of my new persona. I joke around with people on the street now. I joke around with people I know and with family. Everyone around me seems happy and it makes me very happy. Prior to this, people would avoid me, thinking I'd blow up on them.\n* People seem less sinister. When I had my anger issues, I thought people were sadistic and enjoyed watching others suffer. That's what contributed to my anger (considering I'm an empath). Now that I've stepped back a little, I realize most people are like grown children. They just act in certain ways the same way we played policeman or doctor on the schoolyard. Nobody really knows what they're doing and for the most part, don't want any trouble.\n\nA couple days ago, I was dealing with a VERY angry older man (in his 50's). And it reminded me of the old me. I couldn't get angry at him because he didn't know what it's like to be on the other side of the fence. Please let me know if this helped you or if you want to vent.  \n\n\nThanks guys!",

    "title": "Some things to remember about anger",
    "selftext": "Anger is from within. It's not the world and it's happenings that anger us. It is our mind's attachment to things and expectations that anger us, when those expectations and attachments don't conform to our desires. \n\nAnger is like holding onto a hot coal and expecting someone or something else to get burned.\n\nWhen we become angered, we do to ourselves what our enemies would wish. \n\nAnger comes and goes, sometimes very quickly. But the consequences of our anger (saying mean things, breaking things, hurting others, etc.) often last a lot longer than the anger itself. \n\nWhen the anger disappears, we suffer. \n\nAll things that arise must cease, they are impermanent. Always remember that anger will not last, and that it is like a trick of the mind. \n\n\n\nThe solution to anger is a higher/broader level of awareness. When anger arises, you aren't angry. Notice the anger arising and passing. The noticing and 'watching' of the anger is the awareness I speak of. This is what we should cultivate to eliminate anger entirely. \n\nContrary to popular Western/psychological belief, anger can be completely uprooted. I don't believe anger can be utilized for good, it's a hindrance. The mind becomes cloudy, makes poor decisions, gets tunnel vision, doesn't care about the truth, etc. Sure it can help motivate, it can help be assertive, but you can be all these wonderful things without anger. \n\nAnger comes from not seeing things as they are. So when we become angered, simply ask yourself this question: \"How am I trying to mold life/reality to MY expectations?\" This is where the illusion separates from the truth. When you make it personal, you suffer. I will illustrate this is an example below. The absolute subtle moment you make something personal is the moment you suffer:\n\nif you are driving and someone cuts you off, you have a split second decision to act out on the anger or eliminate it, let it go. If you let it go, you'll notice in 30 seconds you are fine, free from stress. But if you feed into it, you'll probably still be stressing in 30 minutes let alone 30 seconds. And if you act out on it, the universe will react. Like dropping a stone in a puddle, our actions go in all directions. \n\nConventional wisdom says don't take it personal, absolute reality says don't take it personal because nothing is. When we acquire a burden that isn't ours as if it is, that's foolish. Instead we should acquire the burden that is ours (weighing skillful vs unskillful actions) and that would be for our benefit. Skillful is that which leads to non-harm and non-stress. Greed and hate, born from self, lead to stress. Whether anger, sadness, anxiety, guilt, etc.\n\nAn angry person is ugly. A happy person is beautiful. Anger leads to ugliness. Happiness leads to beauty. \n\nAll the best to everyone, remember anger will always arise as long as the mind clings to our own version of reality instead of reality as it goes. If you are angry often, consider how you are always wanting things to go your way, instead of how they are. \n\n<3\n",

    "selftext": "My ex-wife was subjected to sick and evil levels of sexual assaults from as early as she can remember until about age 20 or so.  I've always been angry about it.  I've wanted to hurt the man who did it.  A relative of hers, using his power and familial bond to hurt her exponentially more than any person should ever hurt.  A man that ran essentially a rape cult.  A man now in his 80's.  Even knowing that, I still want to just...hurt him.  I do my best not to let this anger take over, but sometimes it just boils up again.\n\nI received an email from a person lookup site that I had created a fake profile on so I could write that he was evil a few years ago.  I wanted to put more, but I knew my wife would find it.  She searches his name often.  That led me down a rabbit hole of sorts of searching online for him.  I knew his wife had passed in September, as my ex-wife had told me.  I found her obituary, and almost left a message on there about him.  She was at the very least complicit in his continuous abuse to who knows how many children, so she was definitely not innocent.  But this message would have been about him.  A hate and vitriol filled message speaking in generalities about some of what he's done.  That he isn't a human, but some truly evil, despicable creature.\n\nThe obituary said to send out thoughts and prayers to him during this difficult time.  Fuck his difficult time.  I want him to suffer.  My only hope is that he has been eaten alive for what he's done to her and who knows who else.  I doubt that's happened though.  I hate what he's done to her and the ramifications on her life from said horrific abuse.  It hurts to even think about it.  Usually, it's just a deep, deep sorrow and pain when I think of what she's been through, but once in a while, like today, I feel a blind anger.  I'm not an inherently angry person.  I can usually push past things decently well, but this all just makes me see red.  I'm not sure why I'm posting this, besides to get it off my chest.  Thank you for reading, if you made it this far.

    "title": "Full honesty: Ive abused my pets.",
    "selftext": "Im going to be fully transparent here, warts and all. Im 21 years old and Ive struggled with my anger most of my life. Ive havent had the best life and I have many untreated mental issues. I think adhd or autism might be the biggest contributor to my anger specifically. Ive always had a big temper and poor impulse control and obviously those two just do not at all go hand in hand. Or I guess maybe they do. Anyway, I was fine with animals for most of my life. My parents would spank our first dog pretty occasionally and I probably did once or twice because I guess I just figured that was appropriate. My parents were not very good with raising us, but I dont really wanna get into that. It wasnt until our third dog that things started getting really bad. Due to what I assume was depression, my temper had begun to get even worse. I was 16 when we first got our third dog, and right off the bat she was incredibly hyperactive. This was fine at first, but it became clear she was a very high maintenance dog and we were not at all prepared for that. She would create colossal messes all throughout the house, get in fights with other dogs and even bite people. She was not a dog we shouldve had and we were not at all capable of raising her. Sometimes she would attack our other dogs and in these moments I would hit her, sometimes pretty hard. When she would make messes I would scream at her and sometimes hit her then as well. Even outside of those moments I treated her poorly though. I would play games with her where I'd pretend to be a monster and chase her around. I know that sounds silly, but I think these games would go too far sometimes and seriously leave her scared. But all this pales in comparison to the what happened one night about 5 years ago. I had just come up home. Im not sure if I was stressed or not that night, but she had made a colossal mess throughout the entire house and destroyed everything. I had mentioned previously I had untreated mental issues and this is where I think that becomes extremely apparent. I basically had a complete breakdown. I'll be honest, I wanted to kill that dog. Part of me did at least. I picked up a knife and placed the tip of it on her. I know now that I never had any intention of actually doing it, but that doesnt change of absolutely terrifying that is. I was completely out of it and wasnt thinking clearly at all. I had carved suicidal messages on the walls in the house as well. I dont know if this was some kind of psychotic break or what, but nothing like that has ever happened since then. There have been more moments of pet mistreatment though, another scenario I can remember when one of my dogs was getting older, he grew blind and would end up peeing in random places throughout the house. One night he ended up peeing on my backpack for school and I ended up grabbing him really hard and bringing him upstairs. He started biting my hands which only made me angrier and I held him tightly and told him really angrily that he couldn't do that to me. Most of this happened from ages 16-18. I have severe mental health issues and as much as I much as Ive regretted these past actions, most of them were the result of my poor health at the time. I dont want it to sound like Im making excuses, so if it sounds that way please let me know. Over the past few years my behavior has improved dramatically and my relationship with my dog is great, but that doesnt erase what Ive done in the past. I try to keep my dogs happy and healthy, but this was definitely not always the case. While I definitely felt a great deal of shame over these actions and the angry, much more malicious person I used to be when I was tempremental, I cant deny Ive struggled with accountability and excuse making in the past. Even now I wont deny I just wanna look at this and say: \"While it was bad, I'm better now and it wont happen again.\" thats all well and good but i really want to truly grow from this, and I want to really soak in how bad it really was, because this was downright ugly and despicable. So please, dont hold anything back after reading this. I want to hear the worst of it, so go ahead and tell me what you all think of this.",

We were toasty but not sloppy. He started off by saying really mean, degrading things to her. We called him out on it but he would laugh it off and dismiss us. You could tell she was getting uncomfortable and she went to walk towards the door and he put his arm across her chest and then grabbed her arm and pulled her back which made me very uncomfortable. I was there with a date of mine who was disappointingly just watching this all unfold. I didn't know what to do to help and my blood pressure and temperature started rising. i could absolutely feel the rage coming on. He said another nasty thing to her while having his hand on the small of her back and she aggressively pushed his hand away and that was followed by him shoving her. At this point i just kind of lost it. I looked at my date and said you need to have my back. I stood up and literally went flying at him like some kind of tree monkey and pushed him up against the wall. He was taken aback and tried to push me off of him so i put my hand on his forehead and pushed it up against the wall while keeping my arm against his chest. I must have had 9 kinds of crazy in my eyes because once i said \"here's what's going to happen, you are leaving for the rest of the night and don't you dare come back\" he looked around the room and sauntered out. His girlfriend broke down when he left and said this had apparently been going on for awhile. She broke up with him the next day. I've been working on controlling my anger for years but I think this is the one time where it actually helped a situation. Even still, i'm sure there was a better way to handle it.

    "selftext": "I have been going to therapy for over a year now for anger issues and other problems. Recently, my therapist and I have been working on my anger and panic attacks, since they can often be triggered by similar things and can produce similar reactions. Two sessions ago, we talked about this thing called \"shark music\".\n\nYou know how in Jaws, when the shark is getting closer the music picks up in pace and volume? When the shark just starts approaching a character, it is a quieter and slow \"duuuuh-duh\" and as it gets closer to them it gets faster and louder until it is \"DUH DUH DUH DUH DUHDUHDUHDUHDUH\", and then the shark eats them. My therapist said that most of the time, before a panic attack or an outburst of anger, there will be \"shark music\", or a building tension that something is just not right or that you are in danger. This will keep building until something finally sets it off, and there is a negative reaction.\n\nFor the past few weeks I have been learning to hear the shark music. When something annoying happens, I now think to myself \"alright, that's shark music\". Thanks to that, I can now start to recognize when I feel that tension and how I feel when I am more likely to go off. I've actually managed to take myself away from the situation or the feeling at some points.\n\nAn incident that really makes me proud of myself was last night. My boyfriend and I were going to a restaurant at 6 pm for a delayed Valentine's day dinner. He said he wanted to meet at my place first and hang out there for a little bit before heading to the bus, but that he had to help his mom run errands first. Well, it was around 4:00 pm and he only then finished helping his mom, making it almost impossible for him to come over before going out (he had to bus here, then we had to bus to the restaurant, it would have just taken too long). I was annoyed, but what can you do? So I said we could just meet at the big bus stop instead and bus to the restaurant together. I had to walk there for 20 minutes, and it was cold and I was pissed about it. Then I realized that I was hearing the shark music, and I knew that I had to calm down. Since my boyfriend doesn't like it when people smoke around him, I had left my smokes at home. Usually, I smoke a cigarette to help me calm down. I knew this would be a toughie. I sort of talked to myself about the situation the whole walk there, discerning reality from my negatively concentrated point of view of what was happening. I probably looked crazy, but I didn't rake my nails against my neck and I didn't start screaming. By the time I got to the bus I was actually in a pleasant mood. Getting over that anger and anxiety without using cigarettes was something that lit up my mood for the rest of the night. ",

My anger still flares up every now and then, especially when problems come up on something that I'm passionate about, but I wouldn't say it's out of control and I rarely hit things or have full-blown meltdowns anymore. I haven't been on any medications for about a year, so all I can chalk it up to is therapy and frontal lobe development. I can't speak for everyone out there, but for me, it did get better.**\n\nI used to hit walls (sometimes still do, but rarely now because I have my face) and other things, but I was causing too much damage around the house (I'm 16, so I obviously still live with my parents). Now my self-face-punching has come back for the first time since 2nd grade. Pillows don't work because I need to feel pain in order to calm down. I've been on every medication imaginable and my Dr is just on the verge of telling me to go fuck myself.\n\nMy anger has gotten so bad, one time I felt like if I wasn't restrained, I would have actually murdered one of my classmates, no joke. I was restrained-- by him grabbing me and slamming my head into a wall when I charged him, giving me a concussion.\n\nAlso, I have (fairly mild) Aspergers, which my Dr says is 100% a contributing cause to my anger. Anger also runs in my family. Both my grandpa's, my great uncle, my mom, and my dad have severe anger issues.\n\nI really don't know what else to do. I don't really know why I posted this except to vent, but while I'm here, does anyone have any tips for calming down?  \n(FYI, deep breaths, meditation, all that stuff doesn't work and never has)\n\nI feel like I'm completely out of options. I don't feel like I can live like this (and no, that is **not** a suicide threat, though I have had suicidal thoughts when I've gotten at my angriest). I've been feeling dizzy the last several days after punching myself really hard and I feel like I'm on the verge of another concussion, which my MD said could kill me. Anyone, please leave any tips you can. Thank you.\n\nEdit: I get angry about the smallest things. I actually get the *angriest* about the smallest things that I could see are easily solvable if I wasn't seeing red.\n\nI also have always needed a person to direct my hate towards. In elementary school, it was several bullies, and same with middle school. But now, surprisingly, I don't hate anyone at the high school I go to. That leaves my asshole next door neighbor as my anger target. She's been harassing my parents about stupid shit and threatening to sue us and other stuff, and even though that's my parents fight and they just brush it off, she's the only person in my life right now (especially in quarantine) who I can direct my anger and hate towards. Sometimes I just scream her name and scream insults (inside my room where she can't hear) even when what I'm actually angry about has nothing remotely to do with her. Does anyone else experience this?",

    "selftext": "UPDATE: \nLots of people seem to be finding this old post of mine recently. I'm glad that it's helped people feel less alone by knowing there's someone out there who feels the same as you. Having said that, I'm very sorry you all feel that way. \n\nI can now say that I've come a long way since that post. Don't get me wrong, I still have that rage, but now I can harness it and use it in useful ways instead of destructive ways. Honestly, without all that anger keeping me going I don't know if I would have made it this far. It's not healthy to survive on rage, but it helped me get through some times that I wouldn't have been able to survive if I didn't have that fight inside me. \n\nI have now found my happiness, and I'm a lot healthier mentally. I still have slip ups, everyone does. The difference is now that even when I've fallen right back down to bottom, I know I'm strong enough to climb back up. I've done it before and I can keep doing it again and again until I learn how to stop falling. \n\nKeep on at it. Don't give up. The anger and pain is normal and natural. It's protecting you so you can make it through. Work with it and use it to your advantage; you have way more passion than most people do if you feel that pure anger and rage deep inside. One day that passion won't come out as anger, it will come out as happiness. I hope you're all okay and I wish you all the best. \n\n\nUPDATE 2: Found out I'm autistic, which explains SO much! I think the comnination of a shit life, being autistic and having CPTSD is the perfect storm for an angry, uncontrollable mess. At least now I really know why it happens and why it's so intense.\n\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nI know why I have anger issues, they come from a traumatic experience I can't get closure with and from growing up in an angry household. \n\n\nWhen people repeat themselves it drives me fucking crazy. I don't know why it does, but it gets to the point where I can't control myself. I shout, I swear, I punch stuff and what's more worrying is that now every time I get angry it feels like my brain is on fire. It hurts everyone I love, and myself. I tell everyone who I get angry with that they only need to say things once for me to hear it and understand and that repeating themselves is my trigger but they keep doing it. I feel like I'm asking too much of them.\n\n\nI can't keep getting angry, it's destroying my relationship. I got angry with my SO today while talking about our problems and I apologised and said it's the repetition that's the trigger and the response I got was that I can't keep getting angry with them, which was repeated 3 times in the space of a minute, so I got angry again. \n\n\nI've talked to my counsellor but her solution is to do deep breathing. It helps when I get anxious but not when I'm angry. I'm going to try and get some CBT, maybe even anger management. \n\n\nI don't know what to do, I'm destroying everything.",

I understand if no one responds!\n\nI've learned that when I start to feel angry, I just need to remove myself from the situation and would find myself calm within minutes and thinking clearly. \nI'm in a long-term relationship with a guy. We usually have barely any problems and are best friends. \nVery occasionally, I feel myself losing my temper. When this happens,  I am aware of it, and tell him I need to be left alone.. but my boyfriend simply ignores me. It makes my blood BOIL.\n \nIt happened just now. \nThe rage feeling gets worse as he ignores me and invades my personal space. I shout again that I need to be alone and walk out of the room. He follows me stubbornly and it escalates - we are both shouting at each other. \nI just repeat, over and over 'get out! get out of this room! Or, I will get out if you won't!' just desperately trying to get the space that I need and he refuses to let me leave, and he refuses to leave himself. \n\nI feel completely cornered and my rage intensifies. I threaten to hurt him, and he seems pleased and kind of 'offers' himself to be hit. I try to push him out of the room, and he won't go. I hit him. I hate the sensation of hitting him and feel like a stupid trapped animal. \nHe stares into my eyes confrontationally, daring me to hurt him - actually saying \"Hit me! Do it!\" like he wants to provoke me into losing it completely. \nI use all my strength to push him out the door and try to close it but he won't let me and I slap him to try and keep him out. It doesn't work and he pushes his way back in.\nI manage to run into another room (the bathroom attached to this room) and lock the door. Only then do I get a moment to myself. Finally I have some autonomy. But I feel pathetic - I have to lock myself in a bathroom to escape. He then went into 'make up' mode, trying to make peace, knocking on the door every so often. \nEven then, he said 'You should be able to control yourself, I don't like seeing you so angry'. It feels so unfair. I said some hurtful stuff.\nI'm still angry and my teeth are sore from clenching. I find it hard to get over him violating my number one boundary (he does know about it).\n\nI don't know how to explain to him (in a way that it will sink in) how it feels like he doesn't respect me, like he's treating me like an animal or child that doesn't know better, when I KNOW when I need a minute to cool off, and I actually communicated that to him repeatedly.\n\nI hate saying hurtful things or hurting him physically, and I would never do it if he didn't literally corner me. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice in how to deal with this? I feel pretty bad about how I acted (getting physical is not ok) but really upset that even in hindsight I can't see any other choices. Except to somehow mask my rage so that he was satisfied I'd 'controlled' myself enough. \n\nDoes anyone understand how I feel or have any advice?\n\nTL;DR: When I get angry, I need space but my boyfriend won't give it to me. More rage and some violence on my part ensues. Need help.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys ! Sorry in advance if my english isn't perfect. This is my story. Everybody in my family, including me, suffer from anger issues. Especially the \"little things\" anger. This anger is a big problem of my life, especizlly for my wife, who cannot stand angry people (she gets scared whenever I am slightly angry even). So this has become hell for both of us. I have a lot of issues especially on the computer and other small things like the pain from knocking my toes on something hard. I get mostly angry for few minutes and then it goes away quickly. I dont even realise when I get angry since its everyday and all the time. I guess when i'm angry I feel disappointed about myself a lot and I tend to say \"Why its only happening to me blablabla, like I'm in the center of attention.\n\n8 days ago, I decided to say STOP to this NIGHTMARE, to this anger that is not me. I hate it. \n\nFew month ago, I stopped coffee, alcohol and cigarette, and I decided to do the same with my anger. \n\nI count the days on my fridge and its the first time I havent been angry in a long time. Basically when something triggers me, I resist and think about the week without anger and I dont want to ruin everything. Really like a cigarette. One can ruin the whole process. \n\nAnd believe it or not I feel much happier than last week, and I laugh more naturally. \n\nThe crazy thing is that I had real withdrawal symptoms after 3 days. Like my body was burning, and I had the impression I had 60 coffees in a row. The 4th day I was super tired. And the fifth day I felt so great.\n\nYou know I came across this idea because I saw a documentary about people that can talk, but decided to stop talking because of psychologic problem. When they cure, they generally cannot speak well because they didnt practice. \n\nWell I think the anger is the same. I truly believe we can forget about it.\n\nFor If you stay in the dark for too long, your eyes get blind, because you dont need vision anymore, so the brain naturally makes you blind. Its THE SAME FOR ANGER. The less you get angry, the more you forget how to be angry. \n\nNine days in 20 minutes for me! Awesome ! Wish me luck !",

    "selftext": "So exactly a month ago, I saw a post on r/All that directed me to this sub - and what I have learnt has helped with my outbursts of rage.\n\nI would get so angry I have physically destroyed (my own) property on numerous occasions. My turning point was getting involved in a shouting match after road rage on my part - and the guy got so angry he almost came after me. I realized I have issues when the smallest things would drive me to hurling things across the room.\n\nSo what I have learnt - and hoping to help someone out as well:\n\n* you have to identify the triggers. How do you feel when you're just about to blow up? Those feelings - when they start coming, practice mindfulness, and self-talk to actualize/realize that you're sliding down that slippery rage/anger slope. Time to stop, count to 3 - and reassess. ***9 times out of 10 this helped me not throw a plate across the room.***\n* pin-pointing the real reason you blow up: for me, i would get especially angry when people cut me off while driving,  don't listen to my opinion (or i tell someone something really cool, then days later they tell me about it and I'm there like, \"seriously? you know i'm the one who told you that). When my SO didn't do the dishes after promising he would.\n\nSo the 2nd one I'm still struggling with - because I had to face up to my own ugly soul - why do I feel so entitled about stuff that actually doesn't matter? Still need to do a lot more soul searching, but i'm glad to announce that it's been 4 weeks of not breaking anything, not banging anything, general peace.So to all you guys - thanks for sharing the tips and techniques. I'm a work in progress.",

I charge my phone, do laundry, you know bum shit. This isn’t irregular for me. He’s welcomed me into his house, he knows what I do there. He pulls up saying all this dumb fucking shit. I’m an addict, a liar and thief. At this point, it’s already 6 pm, I’m packed up and need to leave. He’s dealing with a 2nd divorce and now has some other girl 20 years younger then him.

    "selftext": "For most of my life I have always been a ‘slow burner’ or it takes a long time/build up of many issues to get me really mad enough to raise my voice. Over the past year or so my patience is much shorter than it used to be and I am really surprised at myself and looking for help to manage this. \n\nLately I have been so angry about the past. Looking back it is so obvious how easily discarded I was, how used and taken for granted by mostly everyone in my life. I was only important when I was ‘giving’, but never allowed to ‘need’. So manipulated and always taken from, surrounded by so much passive-aggressive BS. Really realized how different my life could have been if these people got involved. \n\nAt first I thought oh poor you, don’t pity yourself etc. past is past. But it doesn’t feel like self-pity. It is anger. I feel robbed, tricked, lied to, given false hope and angry that I lost so much time loving and waiting for and caring for friends/family who really did not give half a shit about me, my life, my safety, my future or general well being. So many sour memories. They really left me out in the cold so many times and stupid me kept coming back and making excuses for them. \n\nMost of them are out of my life at this point which should be a good thing, but I never really found people to replace them and am mostly alone. The anger toward them keeps coming up. Especially since communication with them has always been kind of twisted so I’ve often felt that I’m automatically in the wrong, no one ever really took my side, never really stood up for me. There wasn’t any closure, I never really got to ‘have my say’ or tell them about the harm they caused me, the damage done...even if they don’t really care, even if they didn’t want to make an effort to make things better, I feel like there is so much I should have said back then and I kept quiet or didn’t say it properly. I am angry at myself for not being assertive and believing lies for so long. I don’t really trust people anymore. \n\nNow I’m stuck. All the anger is coming up over events from a year to over 5 years ago and they keep like replaying in my head and I get all angry and think about all the things I should have said, how I should have seen the BS coming. I am not at peace with myself or others about so many things and it is really distracting me from moving forward in a possible way. \n\nI’ve got a journal and have been writing down like mean letters to them haha and trying to get it all out of my head on paper, but it’s not helping. Partly because so much time has already past. I can’t get the time back and I am just so angry that it was so easy for them to just use me up and discard me like trash and then go about enjoying their wonderful lives while I am in the gutter. It really hurts and I think I’m having some kind of delayed anger reaction or something. \n\nSorry for the long post and thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": " I've had a pretty horrible year (even ignoring the global clusterfluff of Covid, etc.), capped with a depressive episode that started in about December and I am juuuust starting to drag myself out of.\n\nAbout a month ago, my boyfriend of 3 years left me. We had been discussing marriage, kids, and had even bought a house, a dog, and an RV together. We were very, very serious.\n\nAt first, I was angry. Didn't he know how tough my year had been? My dad had been diagnosed with cancer, my best friend from college died unexpectedly, then my dad ended up in the hospital and passed away. Everything was falling down around me! How could he do this to me!?!\n\nNow that I've had time to reflect, I'm not angry. I'm just sad.\n\nI have been a terrible partner. I suck at communicating and I lose my temper easily. I blow up over things like dirty dishes. I slam doors. I ignore my partner and his needs. I ignored him or shut him down or started fights when he tried to talk to me about things that bothered him, things that he cared about. He was supposed to tiptoe around me and my feelings while I completely ignored his needs and feelings.\n\nHe should have left me sooner. I'm honestly surprised he didn't.\n\nI've had my days of self pity. I've had my days of righteous indignation. I've had my days of getting drunk, eating ice cream, binging on Netflix, and feeling sorry for myself.\n\nAnd now I'm ready to be better.\n\nI don't expect him to take me back, ever. But regardless, I don't want to be this person.\n\nI have always justified my behavior because I'm \"better\" than what I grew up with, which is true.\n\nMy dad was an abusive asshole with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (diagnosed during court mandated family counseling after the neighbors called the cops during one particularly bad fight). He had ONE friend, that I know of. He was rude, he was mean, he was arrogant. He pissed everyone off within 10 minutes of meeting them. He was better than his dad and step-dad, at least. They would drink a full bottle of whiskey a night, my dad would just have a couple of glasses. They would break walls, and bones, and souls. My dad only tore out my hair, spit in my face, left bruises in hidden places and broke my spirit.\n\nMy mom is a functional alcoholic who can spit the most vitriolic, cruel, hateful words. She expects people to do everything to her exacting standards and flips out if they don't. I once got screamed at for putting milk on the wrong shelf in the refrigerator. Another time for vacuuming in the wrong direction. Another time for buying a bag of chips when we already had some. Another time for using too many coffee mugs. I remember her throwing plates at the ground because my dad left toast crumbs on the kitchen counter.\n\nSo yeah, I'm better than that. I \"only\" get upset about a sink full of dishes, piles of dog hair building up in the corners, piles of trash on the night stand or desk. I \"only\" slam doors. I've \"only\" thrown a suitcase, punched a wall, screamed into my pillow. But those things are still not ok. I've been in counseling for years and worked on \"getting better\" but I'm still not there. I still lose my temper. I yell. I throw things.\n\n\"Hurt people hurt people.\" And I've used that as an excuse, as a cover, for too long. I want to learn how to be a better person. I don't want my partner to be afraid of making mistakes, to be afraid of voicing his concerns, to feel like he has to tiptoe around me in our shared home. I want to be better.\n\nBut I don't know where to start.",

Poking and prodding me until I lash out, then being offended when I hurt them, their feelings, or break something. A lot of people have laughed at me during meltdowns, in my childhood and even recently. My friends, my family, my teachers, all just laughed it off as if I enjoy being enraged. “Oh that’s just her, don’t worry she’ll get over herself in a second.” I hate my anger, and I hate the feeling of being angry. I don’t want to hurt others, I don’t want to break things, and I don’t want to hurt myself. When will people understand that I hate this part of me, and the last thing I want to do it hurt them? When I’m angry I just feel like there’s no one who understands me and no one there to comfort me, I feel so alone and it just makes me angrier and more upset.\n\nNow I’m not talking about just getting angry at things people say to me that I don’t like. I’m talking about people who know I have anger issues, yet still continue to rile me up even when I’ve asked them to stop. I’ve been driven to tears, pleading my mother and brother to just stop with the snide comments and passive aggressiveness that annoys me so much. To just stop talking to me because I’m trying so hard not to snap and they’re testing me. \n\nBut I also feel conflicted, I don’t know if asking people to stop is the right thing to do. I’ve been treated as the villain, as the problem child and the bully for so long, that I’m starting to think it’s wrong to demand them to not speak to me, or to be careful what they say to me when I’m tetchy. I’ve been such a hassle for the people who love me, that I feel guilty for asking for respect. \n\nI also feel like riling up people with known anger issues is a rather normalised thing too. I see this a lot in media, when the angry person’s feelings are disregarded as something they’ll ‘get over eventually’ or to just ignore them altogether. Even if the person’s anger is completely valid, as soon as they show any anger, all support for them is gone. They’re treated like a little kid who’s a sore loser, instead of a person with actual feelings, who is desperately trying to control this extremely violent emotion. It’s saddening how often I see this. Especially as someone who’s experienced it first hand from the people I love.\n\nThis wasn’t really supposed to be a rant so I’m sorry if it came of like one, but I just wanted to see if anyone felt the same way so myself or someone with the same issue can feel a bit more understood :)",

    "selftext": "I have angry outbursts sometimes that really upset people around me, and it always goes something like this: something makes me angry, I immediately hit something, curse a lot, tears fill my eyes, and then I regret the reaction within 5 seconds and feel immensely guilty, apologise, and then my mood drops because I know I've just been unpleasant to people I love and I have no idea what to do to stop it from happening again.\n\nI've searched around the internet and asked around for advice on how to manage anger, but they always say things like: think before you speak, breathe deeply, divert your frustration to something less harmful or destructive. And I know this is all good advice, but I can't use it because when something makes me angry, by the time I have a second to remember the advice or think about what to do, the anger has already passed. In that moment of anger, I don't remember anything I've learned, I don't care to do any of it, there is just a red flare and my body springs to it and then it's over quickly, and I remember what I should have done, but it's too late to do it.\n\nI'm so at a loss on what to do. I do mindfulness exercises every day, and they have actually been helping a lot with my day-to-day mood, but they haven't helped with the outbursts. I feel so ashamed and a single one of these outbursts just destroys my state of mind for the day because I hate myself so much for them.",

Not sure if any of that helped.)\n\nHe has suggested I start taking anger management classes. I would feel embarrassed to do so. I think therapy might help, but I don’t know where to look/how much it would cost/if I could open up to someone like that.",

I can't kill myself either because I'm too comfortable in my easy but miserable life. I'm becoming more antisocial and I get pissed off easily at people who say \"life is what you make it\" because they don't have one clue what it's like to be me, to have to deal with my mental problems, to cope with the injustices in life. I haven't went off the deep end yet, but sometimes I feel like running someone over just because I feel bad and want to ruin someone else's day. I know I'm a piece of shit for thinking about it, but I truly feel like being evil because lots of people are stupid, and I kind of resent their stupidity, and worse I hate myself because I'm just as stupid. Well, what you gonna do? You can only be as smart or strong as you can control. I understand it's much easier to play \"poor me\", as I have an actual mental disability and grew up without my mother. I try to resist it, but when times get hard, why not play the victim and hope someone helps you? Sadly, what I realized, is some people are destined to go to prison, and maybe someday I'll be dead or in prison soon, because I couldn't better myself because I found it \"too hard\" for me to do. I like death personally, because if I am born as a different human being in another life, I can start over and not even remember my previous life. Sure, life isn't bad all the time, but it can suck if you feel bad all the time, and slowly start to resent society in which you had no say in whether you wanted to be born in it or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you will suggest: \"See a therapist\". Guess what? I am seeing one, and he really isn't helping me. The other ones are way more expensive. Oh well. The best thing I guess I can do if I can't stop being negative is to enjoy watching the world burn. Seriously, I am pessimistic about the future and am glad I don't have kids personally.",

Then I would feel helpless because I knew that I couldn't really ever do those types of things to other people. Then I would get even madder. \n\nSo I went to see a therapist who shared a story with me called The Story of the Two Monks. It really resonated with me then and I didn't feel angry for a long time. So I wanted to share it and I hope that it helps someone else they way that it helped me. \n\n--------\n\nTwo monks were making a pilgrimage to venerate the relics of a great Saint. During the course of their journey, they came to a river where they met a beautiful young woman -- an apparently worldly creature, dressed in expensive finery and with her hair done up in the latest fashion. She was afraid of the current and afraid of ruining her lovely clothing, so asked the brothers if they might carry her across the river. \n\nThe younger and more exacting of the brothers was offended at the very idea and turned away with an attitude of disgust. The older brother didn't hesitate, and quickly picked the woman up on his shoulders, carried her across the river, and set her down on the other side. She thanked him and went on her way, and the brother waded back through the waters. \n\nThe monks resumed their walk, the older one in perfect equanimity and enjoying the beautiful countryside, while the younger one grew more and more brooding and distracted, so much so that he could keep his silence no longer and suddenly burst out, \"Brother, we are taught to avoid contact with women, and there you were, not just touching a woman, but carrying her on your shoulders!\" \n\nThe older monk looked at the younger with a loving, pitiful smile and said, \"Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river; you are still carrying her.\"\n\n-------\n\nSource: [https://www.fisheaters.com/twomonks.html](https://www.fisheaters.com/twomonks.html)\n\n[http://www.taoism.net/articles/zenart.htm](http://www.taoism.net/articles/zenart.htm)\n\nThere's a bunch of different versions of the story.

    "title": "Stop Destroying Yourself",
    "selftext": "It's not often addressed what anger does to you when it's without an outlet. \n\nSome of you have experienced it, although you may not have realized what was happening. \n\nSuddenly you are smoking through pack after pack of cigarettes. You are drinking with a furious purpose, like you are trying to kill a parasite in your brain. Fuck it, I'm doing two lines of coke, or three or four. I'm going to take enough of whatever, until whatever erases this feeling. \n\nMaybe you do dangerous shit. Put yourself at risk so all you have to think about is the risk. You shoplift, shout yourself into fights, in those moments it feels like stretching a cramp. A release in vulnerability, in almost getting caught, in almost getting punched in the face. In almost dying. \n\nIt's all the same thing. It's anger that has no where to go, so it goes in, instead of out. You are on fire, and you want to destroy something. But you are powerless; what you want to destroy is stronger than you, or you can't get to it because of what you will lose if you do. \n\nAnger is energy. No other emotion pumps blood into the limbs like anger. No other emotion turns your head into fire. Anger cuts through depression, burns through fear. Anger turns you into a vessel of white hot, violent possibility. \n\nWhen all that rage has nowhere to go, it starts to eat at what's containing it. When you are furious but powerless, you are going to destroy the one thing you have control over. \n\nYourself.  \n\nYou might see how this manifests in your life. You might be doing right now as you read this. \n\nLetting your anger eat you feels good. You can finally push all that rage somewhere. But it kills you. It makes you weaker, and eventually you'll kill yourself. Some of you might be okay with that right now. \n\nBut it's not okay. It's not okay because when you destroy yourself then everyone around you are proven right. They'll talk about it in sickly-sweet pity. \n\n\"Well he had anger issues, and now he's drinking himself to death.\"\n\n\"She was troubled, and eventually she OD'd. It was bound to happen.\"\n\n When you destroy yourself, you are proving these people right. That you were flawed, and wasting yourself was just the end state of your miserable little existence. Your downward spiral was just more evidence that their life, their views, was the correct way all along. \n\nMany of the people around you want you to eat yourself alive with your anger. Someone with anger issues is a broken person. Not like them. \n\nWhat would piss them off is if you became better than them. \n\nNo one talks about your anger being a gift. That your disease can be directed, aimed like a gun. Instead, they tell you to suppress it. To be calm, meditate, practice breathing exercises. \n\nAll of the techniques professionals and mental health blogs that you searched when you were just looking for a solution are just ways to get your anger to kill yourself so you aren't a hassle to the rest of the world. Are you angry? Stop expressing it, and bury it down where the only thing it can harm is you. There is something wrong with you, and you need to suppress that flaw so you are normal like us. And if all that undisposed energy kills you, well, I guess you didn't meditate hard enough. You weren't mindful enough. \n\nFuck that. Your anger is a gift. You can become furious. It's okay to be angry; who the fuck wouldn't be? What matters is what you do with it. \n\nSo use it. Let the anger out. Use it to be stronger. Use it to prove them wrong. \n\nRun until your lungs bleed. Lift until your legs wobble. Punish your body in a way that makes you stronger, better. \n\nBring the anger when learning skills. You aren't learning your craft so you can appease those around you, so that you can be normal. You are learning to become better than them. A flawed person with anger issues was never supposed to succeed. You were never supposed to win. \n\nBut you have anger. You feel rage. The fury that was supposed to destroy you instead is pushed outward, against expectations, against obstacles. The anger that was once an expression of helplessness becomes a forge for your body and your mind. \n\nYour anger is a gift. Use it against the world. When you are in class, at work, at the gym, let it burn through you. Only then will you realize that anger is just furious energy that wants to fight against something, wants to destroy something. People would rather you use it to destroy yourself. \n\nFuck them, and fuck everyone. You will not use your anger to hurt yourself. You will use it to burn your way into the world, to show them all, that your trauma and experiences has fueled a furnace that gives you and edge against others who don't feel the same. \n\nStop destroying yourself. Let your anger make you better, instead of letting it burn you away.",

I rescued a hapless kitten last year around this time from the incessant rains and it grew to be a nice healthy cat and a month back it had 2 babies. Last night it was ambushed by some stray dogs while I was sleeping. The cat usually ventures out at night and sleeps during the day, it's very hard to stop it from getting out because the house that I live in is very dilapidated and worn out, so there are cracks and crevices through which it can always get out but not so easily get back in. I'm guessing it sneaked out last night and during its late night adventures it must've gotten cornered by these huge ass stray dogs. Man I hate them to death, they've been roaming around the estate for way too long and have always destroyed plants and whatever we plant in the fields, they've even sometimes snuck into out storage area to lay waste to the entire place doing God knows what in there. I should've taken care of these feral dogs. I should've known. But I never thought my healthy and agile cat would ever be one to shy away from an encounter. This one was always extremely limber and extremely quick in its movements. Nevertheless the first thing I saw today morning upon waking up and taking a stroll through my garden is it's dead and unmoving body. Needless to say it wasn't bloodied, it looked like a case of broken neck or crushed windpipe. The corpse had turned rigid. I had to dig a deep grave because of the rains which would always fill any shallow pit and I buried it. Put a few heavy stones on top of it to help the wet sand settle and prevent these fucking dogs from exhuming it at night when everyone's asleep. I don't know what I must do. I never was too playful with the cat but I always fed it the best food(meat and fish) and gave it all the comfort it can get in a house. Now all I have are those two kittens in its stead. I feel like I must send away these kittens to others who may be more inclined to raise them.\n\nThose dogs are getting it soon.",

My wife has never been a very emotional person, but because of my anger issues, she eventually would escalate her anger to match mine.\n\nNow that I'm more controlled, I would talk to my wife when something bothers me, and she would always escalate it and accuse me of yelling at her first. I am consciously NOT yelling and trying to be calm, but then she starts accusing me of shit and it makes me mad as well. I know I SHOULD stay calm, but it's fucking hard when someone insists you're the problem when she's the one that fucked up.\n\nIn this case, it was something as simple as taking out the trash. I normally do it, but I've been swamped. I appreciate that she's taking it out, but when she does, she has a tendency to put the trash on the floor, which has caused puddles of trash juice multiple times. Each time, we talk about it and she agrees to not do it again. Each time, she acts like it's the first time and says \"I already said I won't do it again, what do you want from me?!?!\" What pissed me off this time was, when I asked \"why did you put it on the floor again? I thought we agreed we wouldn't do that?,\" she yells \"why does it always have to be your way? If you didn't come out just now, you wouldn't have even known!\" \n\nShe yells at me first, but accuses me of yelling first. Then she basically admits she does shit behind my back. And all the while, she keeps saying the problem is me. As someone with anger issues, I understand that things can be my fault a lot... but when you do/say shit that makes ANYONE upset, it's not a free pass to just blame my anger for overreacting every time.\n\nI know my therapist would say \"you should just be happy she was helping and let it go,\" but don't we have a right to hold people to their word? To me, this is the hardest struggle with anger management... knowing when you're justified to be upset.",

    "title": "10 Ways To Improve Your Emotional Health",
    "selftext": "Most of the problems that we face in our lives is due to our poor emotional management skills.  Growing up I struggled with understanding my emotions and with expressing them in healthy ways. Some difficult life circumstances led me to repress my emotions. As I will explain in this article, repression is an unhealthy defense mechanism. When I finally got the courage to express myself, I experienced the opposite problem; I would get overly emotional. Finding a healthy medium between repression and emotional explosion is crucial to one’s well-being. Here are 10 ways to improve your emotional health. \n\n**1)** **Understand that all emotions are equal.** \n\nOne of the unfortunate things about the way most of us view emotions is the emphasis we face on happiness and the dismissiveness we show towards other important emotions. All emotions are equally important, and we must treat them with care and respect. Fear is our intuition; it lets us know when are in danger. Anger allows us to set boundaries. Sadness lets us release things that are no longer working for us. Shame allows us to restore integrity. “The Language of Emotions” is a great book that talks about this topic in depth.  \n\n**2)** **Do not chase happiness.** \n\nHappiness is a fantastic emotion. When you are happy, content and feeling joyful about life, you feel like you’re on top of the world. With that being said, happiness should not be chased. You should allow happiness to come and go as it pleases, just as you would with any of your other emotions. Chasing happiness and putting it on a pedestal will ironically lead to unhappiness. Don’t force things. Happiness should come as a by-product of a life well-lived. As it is explained in the book “Flow”, happiness sometimes comes during the flow of things, for example when you are in the middle of working on a project that you are passionate about\n\n**3)** **Do not argue with irrational people.** \n\nThere is little that will diminish your quality of life more than arguing with toxic and irrational people who will bring you down. As a healthy person, you want to live life with calm and centered energy. Furthermore, you want to understand that time is your most valuable resource. Why waste your time on people who aren’t worth it? Why get involved in drama? It’s pointless. It will ruin your mood, ruin your good vibes, ruin your energy, and make you overly emotional about things that don’t matter in the grand scheme of life. \n\n**4)** **Become healthy in other areas of life as well.** \n\nBecoming physically and socially healthy will help you become more emotionally healthy. The human body and mind are interconnected. Exercise, for example, positively impacts serotonin levels in your brain. The same can be said about a lot of healthy practices, such as eating well, sleeping well, socializing, etc. Being healthy will boost your mood and improve your emotional well-being. \n\n**5)** **Do not repress your emotions.** \n\nBottling up your emotions will never end well. Not only will you not develop the skills it takes to understand your emotions and to communicate clearly and effectively, but you will also suffer with physical and psychological health problems over time. Expressing your emotions in healthy ways might not always be easy. Take it one little step at a time and get some help if you need it. When you feel a certain emotion, do not push it to the side; stick with it until it passes naturally. \n\n**6)** **Do not get overly emotional.** \n\nRather than having an emotional outburst and embarrassing yourself, learn how to express yourself in healthy ways. This might be the act of talking to someone who has hurt you and letting them know in respectful terms how it made you feel. It might be the practice of going to the gym and letting off steam. It might be the act of journaling and writing about your thoughts and emotions when you are feeling overly emotional. Whatever your method, it’s important to express yourself and to let off steam in a way that is healthy and socially acceptable. \n\n**7)** **Minimize stress.** \n\nWhether it’s hustle culture, toxic positivity, or social media, we live in a world that is filled with unnecessary stress. Our brains and bodies have not changed much in thousands of years. However, technology and culture have changed drastically in the last few decades. Our brains sometimes struggle in dealing with the fast-paced technology-driven world of the 21st century. It’s important to try to minimize stress as much as you can. Take a break from your phone. Go outside. Have fun with your friends and loved ones. Go on a hike. Get some fresh air. Whatever you do, take time to disconnect and to enjoy life. \n\n**8)** **Live for yourself, not for others.** \n\nLearn how to say “no”. Every day we are faced with thousands of decisions. Make sure that you are choosing what is best for you and what is best for your emotional health. Do not allow external forces to dictate and influence your life and your decisions. These external forces include parents, school, society, teachers, etc. At the end of the day, the only person that knows what’s best for you is you. Listen to your inner voice. \n\n**9)** **Be mindful of the present moment.** \n\nA lot of us spend the majority of our days either dwelling about the past, stressing about the future, or indulging in escapism. We escape reality because we are afraid of confronting it. The reason some people play video games, watch Netflix, scroll social media, do drugs, and drink alcohol is because they want to escape reality. Stop escaping reality. Come to terms with your past, minimize worry about your future, and stay mindful of this present moment. What can you do right now to make yourself smile? What can you do right now to improve your life? \n\n**10)** **Get help if you need it.** \n\nSometimes, all of the steps above won’t help you to the degree that you want because you are in need of external help. There is nothing wrong with this. Sometimes life gets so bad that you can’t do it all yourself. Get a therapist if you can. Contact friends and tell them that you need them. Utilize some of the other services that are out there for people who need help. \n\n**Final thoughts.** \n\nI’m not an expert when it comes to emotional health; not even close. This article is simply a collection of my thoughts, observations, and experiences. I’m sure that in the years to come, much of my thinking will improve, as is usually the case with the passing of time. With that being said, I hope that some of you found some these ideas helpful. Best of luck!",

(Skip down to get to the reasons why)\n\nLet me just preface, I deal with PTSD/Anger mostly from my military experience.\n\nFor three years now I have trained Muay Thai, BJJ, Judo, and Boxing. The results of how it helps with both of my issues have been remarkable.\n\nI tend to give this advice anytime someone posts about them lashing out, so instead here’s just a broad post...\n\n1: Community. It is full of; anger filled, overworked, depressed, not confident, etc. people. This means that you’ll have actual people just like you to connect with and make changes together with. \n\n2: Discipline. Coaches in the MMA community will not BS you. They will make sure that you walk away every class or session, trained well, and learning a lesson that connects to life each time. Plus, discipline a lot of times is a great counter to lashing out.\n\n3: A Great Workout. You will train like you never have before (especially in the 4 martial arts listed above). A healthy body, is a healthy mind. Plus in this day and age, being able to move around, make physical strides, and not just sit on the couch? Sounds like you don’t have to dwell on your issues and you can just let them out.\n\n4: Control. A lot of people believe martial arts increases rage. Negative.

    "title": "How to manage anger using Stoicism",
    "selftext": "Sixteen Best Ways to Outsmart Anger\n\nStoic Philosophy and Anger Management\n\n￼\n\nC Chakrapani\n\nAug 31, 2019 · 6 min read\n\nAncient Stoics recognized anger to be a destructive emotion. Seneca said, “No plague has cost the human race more.” While we may feel good while expressing anger, most of us don’t like being angry and we don’t generally like being around people who are angry. Anger usually makes things worse, not better. As Buddha put it, “Holding on to anger is like drinking poison expecting the other person to die.”\n\nSo how do we avoid being angry? Here are sixteen ways to do so, based on the writings of the ancient Stoics (mostly Marcus Aurelius, but also Seneca and Epictetus).\n\n￼\n\n￼\n\nRecognize it is your opinion that is making you angry.\n\nWe often think it is the other person’s action that is making us angry. But, in fact, it is our opinion of their actions that is making us angry. Suppose someone calls you an idiot. Instead of becoming angry you can just ignore him: “After all it is his opinion. I am not an idiot because he thinks I am one. If he thinks I am an elephant I am not going to be an elephant and I am not going to be upset. Why should I get upset because he thinks I am an idiot?” If you are angry because you are stood up, remember it is your opinion that you should not be stood up that’s making you angry. You can get rid of your anger simply by changing your mind about things — ”It’s no big deal if I am stood up”.\n\n2. Recognize anger has consequences.\n\nThe first flush of anger feels good. When we vent our anger, we feel elated and righteous. But what we fail to recognize is that anger has consequences. It can damage our reputation. But our anger can have legal, moral or material consequences. Before you express your anger, take a moment to understand the consequences of expressing it.\n\n3. Recognize your anger hurts you more than the thing that made you angry.\n\nCount the costs of being angry. When you do, you may see that the costs of being angry are far higher than the costs of being calm, even when you think you have reason to be angry. Anger adds to the damage you suffered much more than the act that caused you to be angry.\n\n4. Recognize that the person who makes you angry is not that different from you.\n\nWhen we are angry with someone, it may be a good idea to reflect that we are not very different from each other. As human beings, we all do things for similar reasons. Two people may want to be happy, but one may think their happiness comes from hoarding money and the other may think their happiness comes from helping others. Why be angry with another person who is doing what we are doing, only differently?\n\n5. Think of the times you have done things that are similar to what the other person has done.\n\nWhen we are angry about something, we don’t realize that we have done similar things in the past. If we think back we will see that we acted in a similar way in the past. We justify our behavior but fail to see ourselves in others.\n\n6. Recognize that if the other person is wrong, they suffer the consequences, not you.\n\nLeave the other person alone to face the consequences of their actions. On the other hand, if you become angry, you have to face the consequences of your anger.\n\n7. Recognize that the other person is ignorant.\n\nIf someone deliberately wrongs you, it means the person is ignorant. An ignorant person deserves your understanding or pity and not your anger.\n\n8. Recognize that your anger is contrary to Nature.\n\nAnger is against another person. But we are like different organs of the body made to work with each other, not against. If you have a headache, you don’t get angry with your head because it is part of your body. Similarly, if someone hurts you, you don’t have to get angry with that person. We are part of the same society; it is contrary to Nature for one part to work against another.\n\n9. Recognize that your anger may be unjust.\n\nJustice needs accurate judgment, based on all facts. When we are angry, we don’t usually have all the facts. We act on our ‘impressions’ without examining them before responding. A colleague who ignored you when you greeted him may have been just diagnosed with something serious. Someone who ignores your friendly gestures may not be hostile but shy.\n\n10. Recognize your anger may be due to your faulty self-perception.\n\nVery often our anger is generated by a sense of entitlement. We are angry if someone disrespects us because we feel entitled to respect. We are angry at the government because we pay too much in taxes because we feel entitled to pay less in taxes. We won’t be angry when we realize we are not entitled to anything external to us.\n\n11. Recognize that you have the power to endure.\n\nWe get angry because we can’t ‘stand it anymore’. But you have the resources to cope with the situation without getting angry. Think of your internal resources such as endurance and patience. Use them. You don’t have to act helpless and be pushed around either by what others have done or by your own anger.\n\n12. Realize what others do is not under your control but what you do is under your control.\n\nWhatever someone says to make us angry is not under our control. Whether we want to be angry about it or not is under our control. If we want to be happy, it is pointless to try to control what is not under our control. We will be much better off to control what is truly under our control.\n\n13. Recognize that everything has two handles.\n\nWhen we are angry we think our anger is the only way to handle the situation. But that is not true. There’s always another way to handle the situation. For example, if a friend says something that hurts you, you are angry with him. But there is another handle. That handle may be a thought like “He has been a good friend for so long. What he did hurts. But, if I am honest, I can see that I have hurt others too.” This handle will diffuse your anger.\n\n14. Recognize that life is short.\n\nBoth you and the person you are angry with will be dead soon enough. See things in perspective. Do you want to waste your life being angry even for a minute?\n\n15. Avoid people and situations that arouse your anger.\n\nThis is not a true solution to anger. However, until you become strong enough to avoid anger, avoid people and situations that quickly provoke anger in you. But eventually, the true solution to anger is to avoid anger under all conditions, not just avoid people and situations that provoke anger in you.\n\n16. Develop a contrary habit.\n\nAnger can become a habit. Once you are angry it gets easier to get angry the next time. How do you get out of the habit of anger (or avoid it becoming a habit)? Epictetus has some good advice here: Develop a contrary habit. For example, laughter is a contrary habit because you cannot laugh and be angry at the same time. So, whenever you are angry, find something funny in the situation and smile about it. Or you can simply laugh at your own self-importance expressed as anger.",

    "selftext": " So I (25m) put my hands on my gf (21f). I don’t usually go to Reddit for my problems but been seeing a lot of ppl open up on here about it so I figured why not since I can’t seem to find answers elsewhere. \n\nTo start off, we have been having a lot of communication and trust issues since she came back from school a couple of years ago. Some stuff she admitted to ended up causing me to have some very huge doubts before she left back in 2022. During the time she was gone she faced some hard times financially and ultimately had to cut her semester short and came back home and moved in with me shortly after. I helped her get back in her feet which was still somewhat hard considering that we now argued nonstop due to the unresolved issues that were created before she left. \n\nFast-forward to 2024 and she and I both were now back in school for the winter semester. She was up late one night going out of her mind typing a paper and I was dozing off to sleep. During this time we were facing some intimacy issues and blocks that we didn’t have a problem with in the beginning but it became a developing issue over the past year. While I was falling asleep I thought she had been rubbing up against me so I got excited and tried to initiate some fun time while half sleep. Completely forgot about her working like a mad woman on this paper. Well she obviously didn’t wanna do anything because while she had finished the paper she was understandably exhausted. Me however frustrated and sleepy took this as her trying to tease me and I started arguing with her. She explained that she hadn’t tried touching me and that I was imagining it which at the time I was sure that she had and thought she was now trying to gaslight me into an argument.\n\nWell long story short we got into a shouting match. I then got aggressive and grabbed her by the throat and pinned her down telling her that I hated her. Instant regret when I saw the look of pure fear in her eyes towards me. I began to hysterically blame her for me getting like that and asked her why she made me do it. I was a fool. I was dead wrong no matter how I felt, I reached a point of no return and didn’t know how to take back what was done. Long story short we “made up” in the moment. She explained that she wouldn’t forgive me until I made things truly right with the situation and I agreed.\n\nA few months have passed now and there have still been some pretty bad arguments. Nothing physical like before. I vowed never to do that again and haven’t but she constantly brings this up in any argument. I’ve even suggested her breaking up with me or a break up in general but neither of us can seem to really follow through with that. I love her and from what she says she loves me too. I guess I need advice from ppl who don’t know us. Or just harsh truths. Something. We can’t talk to our families about it really for obvious reasons so here I am.\n\n\nEdit.\nI greatly appreciate everyone’s honesty and opinion. Some were harder to read than others. But more or less humbling. I needed to vent this out and speak on what I had done. I hate myself for how she’s been treated by me especially knowing that she already grew up in a lifestyle of abuse. I see no reason to update or keep this up any further as I’ve gotten the answers that I need. Thank you all",

People going in front of you in lines or once insulting you means somehow that they can continue to insult you until they get a reaction but when you stand up for your self they laugh, which makes you never stand up for your self again and take even physical abuse but it is mostly psychological like them throwing things at you. Like, I didn't sign up for that, it is them who are disrespectful but I am tired of having to throw things back or speak up for my self, it seems unless someone cool spoke up for me they didnt go away and just continued to push and hover over me because they knew I couldn't handle being touched. How is that a weakness, you are clearly making me uncomfortable and enjoy it. They never change so I want to change and prevent such situations. Like what do I say? I was never good at comebacks, arguments anything. And at the very best if I am not threatened to be beaten up I get told to shut up and I do and listen like a good little girl since I have been victimized since childhood and conflicts make me feel like I am drowning with no access to oxygen and it feels like my entire body is on fire and in pain. How do you...just argue back and not break down mentally or want to run away?\n\nHow do you not feel a huge hole in your stomach and severe physical pain from just defending what is yours from someone who is nasty and continues to take and take and take while you try to blend with the walls and become invisible while they think your quitness is annoying and rude, but if you ever talk and laugh they attack you. I have had a lot of situations like that in school and it seems to be related to anxiety, and people attacked me more when I was unsure, anxious and insecure but I could not control my fear or shaking, I almost felt like fainting. However since such situations are part of life and I can self isolatre so much, I want to learn how to manage them. I want to learn to push back/fight back and make such people lose interest in me. What is so interesting about my mental illness preventing me from speaking due to fear and them taking advantage out of that and thinking they are on top of the world is beyond me. All I do is just do my thing and there is always some guy and his friends to ruin it, while it mostly happeend in my teen years I want to learn how to prevent it, as a woman. I want to live my life and not hide in my room behind a screen all day. I want to smile without feeling like someone is going to bully me again, because I am happy and they can't handle it. I have had teens and old people be mean to me on the street and the bus, but I don't know why, which is why I am writting this. I cannot prevent their behavior, only I can control how I can react, so how should I react? What is the correct way to react? Do you glare? Laugh? I am not witty and tend to freeze.",

I need that connection.. to feed me. \n\nI may sound like a bitch, but I am nothing but an empty sack of flesh and bones... I only feel for myself and sad for myself.. I don’t care about anyone. I expect everyone to chase me and having a big ego while trying to have a relationship is like an armless man trying to do pull ups.... doesn’t work.\n\nI have an insane workout routine that keeps me mentally sane. When I hit that punching bag, is equally the same as taking a big shit... Soo emptying and satisfying. In fact, anger isn’t always supposed to be adrenaline like or warm. I feel it almost all the time.. it’s like I dissociate and forget to breathe and forget about my surroundings; exactly how I’ve been feeling since my 15th birthday. \n\nI’ve already got a few gray hairs in my head from all the rage I contain at such a young age, and I am just going to end this post by saying that I see no hope for myself.. and only destiny itself will determine how I’ll end up.

Recently, I had enough of their anti-American BS. Not only that, my brother tagged me in a post, it was a post ridiculing me, and he started basically bullying me in the comment section, my aunt appears out of nowhere and starts chanting and supporting my brother as he tells me how I am this and that and how no one loves me over there etc. I cannot stand this bullshit, I am so enraged by my treatment, by my disrespect, how it’s always my age. I hate this so much. I recently deactivated after my brother described only to see him reappear in my Facebook and he UNFRIENDED me after literally no reason.

I realized that its not even really a conscious thing, I tend to just do it and stir myself up over trivial shit...and its my own fault, because I seek that kind of stuff.

    "title": "You have the right to feel anger",
    "selftext": "Good evening everyone. I decided to write this post because I was experiencing anger due to being paralyzed by fear of doing something that I need to do to accomplish my main dream which is bodybuilding.\n\nAt first as I tried to complete the task and I was unsuccessful due to this fear, I felt sorry for myself so I took a nap and tried to complete the task again but I failed. A bout of rage and frustration came over me and at the stage I am at now in maturity, I decided to lay down and forgive myself so I’m writing this will also brainstorming how to go forth.\n\nWhen I was younger I got a traumatic brain injury from running into a steel door at 4 years old and I my mom drank and did drugs while I was in the womb. As a child and teenager I went through many traumatic experiences at home and my anger was dismissed like many of us on this sub. This made me have uncontrollable rage and I allowed things to bottle up until I completely unleashed it and I was labeled a monster by the people who I unleashed hell upon. My mom, other members of my family, partners etc. I never raged for no reason though.\n\nBut then I thought about it. Did me demonstrating how powerful I can be when I rage help anything. Did it change the people that hurt me? Sometimes I would rage against myself because I was angry with myself. Did that help me? No it didn’t. When does unleashing rage ever truly help. It may make us feel temporarily relief but then we go back to hating ourselves or the ones that caused us to rage. \n\nIt is okay to feel anger. We should not be little betas that allow ourselves to be walked all over like doormats. Whether by others or ourselves. However, we should devise better plans of action. \n\nMost of the time we rage because we feel powerless. I’m here to let you know we are very powerful and we don’t have to demonstrate uncontrollable rage to receive power. If anything, we just make ourselves look dumb and a person that is out of control will never be respected. We are either pitied or looked down upon. People on drugs may be out of control sometimes and what does society think of them? They view them as dumb, they feel sorry for them, they look down on them or they are disgusted with them. Drugs don’t make our true problems go away and neither does unleashing rage. It just provides temporary relief.\n\nIf you want to get revenge on the world, the ones who hurt you, or yourself; control yourself, make progress on yourself, decide you will not let rage shackle you, and love yourself because no matter how many mistakes we’ve made nor how many people have told us what we don’t deserve; we CAN change and we can revoke the power we give to others & mistakes that try to define us. \n\nI hope this message helped you in some way to know your feelings matter. But please give more time and thought into your actions and what effect they’ll have. I hope you are comforted by a blanket of peace today.",

    "title": "I Daydream About Killing People, I Want to Stop",
    "selftext": "This is a really difficult post for me to write, but here it goes.\n\nFor years now, I've had this issue that I can't find a medical diagnosis for, but it bothers me considerably, to the point where it's destroying my life and causing me a great deal of torment. \n\nEssentially, I have this issue where I become so incredibly enraged over someone who angered me in my past, that I begin to bite my right hand and imagine myself killing or torturing the people I'm angry at. Sometimes I imagine torturing, mutilating or killing their children. Some of the darkest fantasies are when I \"break\" these individuals completely, so they are docile, weak, scared and ashamed. Even worse, is when I imagine \"breaking\" their snarky attitude, ego and confidence to the point where they murder their own children.\n\nDuring this time, my heart rate increases considerably, and I sometimes even sweat or begin to sweat. Again, I can't find a medical term or diagnosis for these \"moments of rage\", other than maybe PTSD? I was in the US military and I was constantly getting yelled at, degraded, made fun of, and after so many years of this, I guess it took it's toll on me. This was NEVER a problem until after I left the military, as I kept journal entries back then.\n\nThis anger haunts me daily. The people I'm angry at are always in my head, taunting me, laughing at me, bullying me. My mind spontaneously replays the episodes that fill me with rage and anger all the time. Its come to the point where I'm afraid of the anger. I can feel it \"creeping\" up on me or lingering in the background. The only way to extinguish it is by biting my hand and going through these \"episodes of rage\".\n\nThe people I'm angry at bullied me, pushed me around, or did things to me that were completely unwarranted or uncalled for. For example, when I was in high school, I had my wisdom teeth removed by this dentist who didn't use a topical anesthesia on the roof of my mouth before injecting me with the actual anesthesia to numb my mouth. He did this to get back at me, because there was some disagreement over something that I don't quite remember.\n\nThis happened over 15 years ago, but all of a sudden, the anger  and rage I have towards this person bothers me now. I don't go a day without wanting to kill this guy and get back at him.\n\nAnother person I want to kill is my childhood friend's mother, who yelled at me for laughing at her son when he belly flopped into the pool. She walked up to me and grabbed my arm, pulling me into her and yelling into my face \"DON'T YOU EVER LAUGH AT HIM AGAIN!\". I can still remember the look on her face and the feeling of her squeezing my wrist, it hurt. \n\nBecause of feelings like this, I'm always \"on edge\" and anything overly emotional, or loud will cause me to have one of these \"episodes of rage\". They are totally random and spontaneous as well. For example, the bathrooms at the company I work at have these Dyson air hand dryers that make a lot of noise and I avoid using them because I'm too afraid of triggering another \"episode of rage\".\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but as you can tell, I had to get this all out. I've been to therapy over this, but all they told me was \"do deep breathing exercises and meditation\". I was told by someone on here to \"let this all go\" but I'm not sure how.\n\nCan someone please direct me to some resources where I can get help from this? Thank you so much! :)",

Two years after begging and begging to go to court and make it so I don’t have to go, little 12 year old me realized that if I don’t have the autonomy to make them go away then I could just push them away myself. \n\nFrom that point on, I made every communication with that parent a living hell. I would be short, sassy, and barely speak on phone calls. I would throw tantrums and never be happy while visiting just to show how miserable I felt with them and hope they think “what a pain, I don’t want to deal with that anymore.” Which is exactly what happened. \n\nI didn’t speak to that parent for ten years. We discussed it all and are now on great terms. My anger for that parent and my childhood is gone. However, teaching myself and pushing myself to be the WORST VERSION of myself while with that parent created a behavioral trait. I was 8-13 during those ‘fighting years’ if you will, so during one of the most important emotionally developmental part of my life I trained myself to be a bitch. \n\n\nThere it is. That’s it. I have my answer. I understand it. I see it. Now I need to grow past it. To move on. To change my behavior. \n\nI did it then. I can do it again.",

I couldn't do or say anything nice without having some kind of negative thought in the back of my head, whether about myself or the situation. It caused me to be insecure, it caused me to be bitter, and it caused me to be hateful. Eventually the parasite drained me and my relationships untill they left. I spend everyday wishing I could make it up to my son, ex wife, her sisters, and my ex mother in law who took the brunt of the abuse. When all they wanted to do was love me. I'm nowhere near where I want to be, but I'm nowhere near where I was. It's like waking up after a night of heavy drinking and bad choices. All you're left with is guilt, regret, and bad feelings. I hope people read this and similar posts and decide to get help, not necessarily about anger, but anything you feel might be holding you back. Because life and the people in it are worth your full attention and full effort. Most times people are in your life because they want to be.",

Got cut off in traffic, *click, click, click of the grip trainer*, was late to pick up the kiddo by a few minutes *click, click, click.* had to go get stuff for the wifelys monthly demon and other stuff. Got stressed out in the parking lot because of trying to figure out plans, *click, click, click.* *click, click, click.* *click, click, click.* *click, click, click.* got into an argument while in the car waiting on scripts to be filled. *endless clicking* got to the park finally for a picnic, play time with the kids.

Growing up my mother wasn't an awful parent nor an awful person, but to say she was there emotionally or had the patience to raise a child would be an outright lie. She would often explode over small things and she had no real normal mood. One minute she would be your best friend and the next she'd be screaming, threatening to hit, etc. She had zero patience for mistakes and if you dared to mess something up in front of her it would be a 30 minute verbal dress down, or at times a spanking. Growing up this gave me a sort of \"fear\" of my mother and what she represents that I vowed from a very early age to never see myself act the way she did during my childhood. Anyway, as time went on growing up I was diagnosed with ADHD and major depression and just around 2 years ago I went through some more trauma which eventually ended up in my parents splitting and myself growing distant from them physically as well as emotionally. I've found that recently I have become a bit numb to certain things and I become irritable very easily. This causes me to lash out at people I care about and would do anything for like my girlfriend or my friends. I act very similarly to how my mom did, very rude and brash, passive aggressiveness. I always feel awful after because I know I get this from her and its my fault I can't control it. It's caused me to spiral into alcoholism as of late and I just want to know if any other people here have experienced something similar? If so, how do you deal with it?

I don’t know how to deal with it. I punch shit, I curse out the piece of shit that cheated on me every now and then. But it’s so out of character for me. I hurt myself just to feel something, anything at all that’ll distract me from my anger. I cut myself a few weeks ago. It felt right in the moment and the pain was oddly satisfying.

I constantly get gaslighted if I try to talk to someone who used to be my best friend and everything gets thrown back at me like it’s my fault.

Everything is MY fault. I can take accountability for my actions, but how I feel is NOT my fault. People are pieces of shit and I realize that more and more each fucking day. I hate this world and everyone in it. I wish it would fucking explode and everyone dies in a fiery death, me included. And I hope it hurts the entire fucking time.

Before long my eyesight started to flicker in and out of what I could only describe as being all black with vague white sillhouettes outlining people and objects.

It's the closest thing to a pure primordial rage, or \"viking Beserker\" state I could think of, but even asking around people with bad anger issues I haven't had anyone get a good description, because usually they \"blackout\" and don't remember.\n\nHas anybody else experienced this, and if so, could you provide insight or details of what exactly it is?",

    "title": "How to let your anger pass when you can’t remove yourself from the situation?",
    "selftext": "Hi, this is my first post so I hope this is okay. A lot of anger management techniques that I’ve read about require you to remove yourself from the situation that is making you angry, whether it be working out, going for a walk, listening to music away from others, etc. This is what usually works for me. I leave, do something else, come back and I’m usually not angry anymore. But, there are also times when I’m in the car with someone, a situation happens, I get angry, and I feel stuck because I can’t leave. This usually puts me in my head festering in my thoughts, and since I don’t want to lash out at the person, this leaves me very quiet, and makes me not want to talk to them because I don’t want to talk with an attitude. Even when I’m quiet and try to do breathing techniques, or shift my focus to something different, I can’t seem to fully emerge from the post-anger-mood-dampened feeling until I leave the car and greet my dogs or go into my room alone. Frequently, I get ridiculed for being quiet because I’m in “a bad mood the entire time” (even when the conversation is not at all being initiated by the other person). Even if the conversation is being carried on by the other person, I can’t just be fake and respond happily, as I am not happy, so I just respond with what I have to, and don’t further the conversation, which people view as being short with them, and they’re not wrong, but I just don’t know what to do differently. I honestly just don’t know what to do in this situation since I can’t remove myself and do something else to fully get over it. I hope this wasn’t to hard to follow. Thank you to whoever reads this, I’d really appreciate any advice. \n\nTLDR: I don’t know how to let anger pass when I can’t remove myself from the situation",

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m a 22 f struggling with an odd problem- I get irrationally, blindingly angry. This probably came from my childhood, it was a very tit for tat kind of environment ‘spare the rod spoil the child’ish. It’s not often and usually I’m well aware I’m being irrational. \n\nThe problem is when it’s invoked at random. \n\nMy cat is a bitter, the humane society made sure we knew and it’s been two years now so it’s mostly trained out except for the occasional, too-hard love bite when he wants food or to play. It’s bad, like you’ll be bleeding bad. When he bites me like this, for a moment I’ll get this blinding rage, not always but it’s often enough that I’m worried. I would never hurt my cat, I won’t even use a spray bottle on him, but for a second all my muscles just tense and I want to reach for him. I have no idea what would even happen if I did in that second, but after a tense moment passes, my jaw unclenches and my hands unflex and I remember he’s inherently good.\n\nI want kids- desperately. I know I’m still young and my fiancé and I have no plans during the pandemic to have any. I’m horrified by my own thoughts- my own anger. I don’t want to lash out at my child if they do something that’s a non problem, like draw on the wall or spill a drink. In the Shinning I read about Jack grabbing Danny roughly, just trying to get him away from his documents and accidentally breaking his arm, knowing he was being too rough but not caring enough. I don’t want that to be me.\n\nSorry for the long post. If anyone else has experienced this or just has any advice I would love help. Thank you for your time",

I was abused as a kid so I think it stems from that. But I know that a stranger being rude or flippant shouldn’t arise an intense urge to flip out or be violent. I’ve never acted on it, but this repressed rage scares me. \n\nMost people consider me a very kind person, and I’m generally pretty calm and patient. But when I feel like someone is being rude to me for no good reason it suddenly triggers this intense wave of involuntary rage that sometimes stays with me for hours. \n\nI don’t know if this is the right thread, but I could really use some advice from anyone else who struggles with anger and has learned some good coping mechanisms.",

I love my wife and son more than anything in this world, they are everything to me.\n\nSo why do I treat them like crap?\n\nLately my toddler has really been testing me. He knows how to push my buttons. I get it, that's what toddlers do. He isn't doing anything wrong outside of a little mischief. \n\nMy wife was a preschool teacher for 15 years and has a ton of experience with this exact age groups. So she knows exactly how to handle him when he starts to get into it with us. She also has the patience of a saint, I don't think I've ever heard her yell in anger once.\n\nI have struggled with my temper and anger for a very long time. Not to make excuses. But growing up my dad was constantly yelling at me, my siblings, and my mom. Very angry all the time, even about stupid things.\n\nNow that I'm almost 40, I'm finding myself more and more getting the same way. \n\nTonight is just one instance. Little one was not listening, ignoring me when I was trying to get him to put his books away so we could go down and have dinner. I felt my anger starting to rise, and I eventually started to yell at him.\n\nWe got downstairs finally and in his high chair he began slamming his hands down on the tray over and over. This makes me so angry for some reason. So I yelled again. My wife suggested I go eat my dinner in the other room to cool off. Because I'm already into it now, I ignore that and start getting mad at her for saying that.\n\nI start laying guilt on her. She doesn't know what it's like to have such problems controlling anger, she doesn't get the struggle I have. She's not being understanding. Etc.\n\nOf course, almost immediately after the words come out I know it's bullshit and I feel like a total asshole, again.\n\nI ate my dinner with them, at the kitchen table, in silence. My son kept looking at me and I wouldn't even make eye contact. I have barely said a word since and that was almost 2 hours ago.\n\nThis is the pattern with me. Something stupid sets me off. I blow up, yell, and say hurtful things. My wife seems to ignore it but I know it hurts her when I do it.  And almost immediately I know I was wrong and feel like the worst person. Which I know I am, to be acting like this.\n\nSome days I do ok. Some days things don't bother me and when I start to get annoyed I can keep my cool. But some days are like today was. Annoyance becomes extreme anger, and blows up. Then I just feel like I feel now, incredibly sad the rest of the night, about what happened. I have lost count of the number of times I've apologized to my wife (and now, my son) about this kind of stuff.\n\nI really don't want to keep the cycle going and have my son see the angry behavior and learn that that's the way to act. I want him to be a kind gentle person that treats people with respect. I want myself to be that too.\n\nI am seeing a therapist but I don't feel it's helping much. \n\nI don't know what else to do, but I'm afraid one of these days she's going to decide she's had enough and take our son and go.\n\nI can be such an asshole.",

    "selftext": "I'm devastated and shattered and I need help.\n\n I found this subreddit today and I've been reading loads of helpful posts, but I need to tell someone how I feel and to get help with how to console my girlfriend. I'm terrified I'll be judged by my friends and family if I tell them I scared her with my anger. \n\nI was tired, we'd had an amazing day together getting work done and then relaxing in the sun - I'd gotten irritated earlier when I got too hot but apologised shortly after and just put it down to the heat. We've been working a lot over the last few days and it's been really hot weather so today I was pretty exhausted from the get go.\n\nAnyway, we've had a long day and we're at home and dinner is ready, nothing fancy just been cooked in the oven, but all our dishes are dirty so I start doing the washing up. My hands are in the hot water and I'm hot in general and my girlfriend is trying to find which salad we bought today and which one is old.\n\nNow I'm aware this is a totally ridiculous thing to get mad about, and I'm so embarrassed and horrified it happened, but she kept talking about which one is new and which one is old. Even throwing one in the bin and getting it back out. \n\nSo I'm unable to help as my hands are in the water and soapy so I'm just telling her to check the 'Use By' dates to see which is new. But she says she's can't find them. Then she's saying that this one looks newer etc and Im starting to get angry and saying 'just check the dates!' and she says she can't find them, but all food has dates on it so I'm getting wound up, I feel so annoyed she can't do something simple like check the dates on these salads and she's still talking about what's new and what's old and examining the leaves etc.\n\nSo I snap, and I spin around and say something like 'i can't look' (I don't remember exactly what I said... Which is weird) and then I flicked the water on my hands on her, right at her face. My teeth were clenched and I was obviously super angry and I saw her face drop and she was so upset. I felt mortified immediately, it was such an aggressive act over something so pointless and meaningless and it hurt her bad.\n\n I was close to her face with my hands and she said I was going to hit her, and honestly it was blind rage and I could have. My brain wanted to tell her I was washing up so couldn't check stupid dates so I flicked her with water but it was close and my movements were definitely aggressive.\n\nSo she is crying and I don't know what to do. I finish the washing up and check the salad and there isn't a date on either pack anywhere. I didn't trust her and I assumed I could do it right and she couldn't. \n\nMy dad has a very short temper and used to hit me as punishments when i was younger, all my friends all my life have been scared of him whenever they came over. He would even shout at them. I am so ashamed I saw so much of him in me today. He is often rude to my girlfriend and I feel so guilty she has to deal with my family, but today I was just as bad. \n\nI'm awkward and shy with strangers and have no self confidence I've never been in a fight and I never retaliate to bullies or antagonists, I'm a coward. But i have a temper and it comes out, it used to come out on my siblings (and them on me) and now my girlfriend has seen it. I'm so embarrassed but I'm a coward I've even thought about killing myself in fear of her telling anyone - I would never do this, I am so happy with her but this just shows how cowardly I am, I can't even face a mistake and my mind instead turns to suicide.\n\nI'm sorry for typing this all out but I have no one to tell. I hope she forgives me and I will continue to read this subreddit to try and help myself deal with my anger, hopefully I can catch it before it destroys my relationship. But I need to know how I can make her feel safe with me again.",

    "selftext": "It seems this sub is a dwindling one, but I need to get this off my chest, so, incoming wall of text.\n\nMy anger is ruining my marriage. I’m 25, father of four. New home owner, new car owner, new job, same ugly anger. Growing up, my dad was very abusive. Came home drunk a lot. Hit me, hit his girlfriends, hit walls, hit fridges, hit cars, hit a lot of things. He spent a fair time in prison for hitting his ex wife. Spend many nights contemplating suicide or running away as a child, largely because when my dad couldn’t control his anger, his anger-relief method of choice was putting his hands around my throat.\n\nHis response to my crying, which was usually a result of his anger, was more anger. Belittling me with words, physical violence, talking down my emotions. There’s a lot more backstory with my dad, but realistically it’d take way too long to type out, but this is how a majority of my childhood played out. He never really went to therapy, wasn’t for him. When I was 16, I finally told my dad I was sexually abused by a neighbor when I was 8. His response? Anger. His words are forever burned in my heart. The look of his distorted face with traces of disgust etched in my mind. “That explains a lot. You need help” he said, in a repulsed voice. \n\nEver since then, I never wanted my dad to think I was weak again. \n\nI also never wanted to be like my father, in any way shape or form. \n\nWell, this year, my wife and I were suppose to get married in May. We found out we were pregnant in January, so we pushed the wedding date to January. The baby ended up being an ectopic pregnancy, so on feb 7th my wife got rushed to the ER due to her tube rupturing and her bleeding internally. I was so scared. When she got out of surgery, she was so frail and in so much pain, I was so patient and attentive to her emotions and needs. Things were going surprisingly well despite the circumstances.\n\nIn April, we managed to survive buying our first house. \n\nIn May we decide to try to conceive, in June we successfully did!\n\nIn July we found out our baby stopped growing, that we had miscarried. \n\nMy wife came home a mess, I expected to be able to handle this like a champ since I did last time around.\n\nI failed. \n\nHer depression became so severe she needed medication. I got mad about that. I don’t even know why. Her depression meds caused anxiety, so she needed medication for that. Which made me more mad, because I have this fear she will just be more and more medicated for life.\n\nHer anxiety got worse, so they prescribed a mood stabilizer. The pills keep adding up, her depression keeps getting worse. She’s seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist to get help, but it’s not working. \n\nI get so angry when she starts crying over nothing. I’m not saying that as a rude husband, I’m saying that as someone who has talked to their spouse and she has said there is no logic in why she gets upset sometimes, it’s just sudden and overwhelming.\n\nI want to find a solution. I talk and that turns into her getting offended and she throws things out at me, I get more angry in return, and the cycle continues until she’s hitting herself and I’m pacing with clenched fists. \n\nI’ve been trying to keep a leash on my anger. When she gets upset, I try understanding. I try being patient. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. I can’t recall off the top of my head but when we start getting into a spat, I feel so offended and angry for some reason and things spiral downward, but I’ve never been physically violent. I usually get loud and cry, or when I’m being an idiot, I aim to hurt with my words.\n\nWell, this past weekend we got into a spat over something. She couldn’t contain herself and her emotions and neither could I. I gave her a stupid, unrealistic ultimatum. “You need to leave. You need to get out until you can get your shit together.” And as she goes for the door, fear kicks in and I said “if you walk out that door, we’re going to have much worse problems”. Now that I am not angry, logical self says that was actually stupid to say. Damned if she does damned if she doesn’t. \n\nShe started yelling something, I don’t remember, and I yelled back “get out of my house” which sparked anger in her, since this is both our house and she busts her ass every day at work to help pay to maintain it. She punched me in the chest, she doesn’t remember that. She says she “barley even touched me”, but I remember it clearly because it triggered a rage in me. It triggered my fathers anger. Next thing I know I’m pushing her into a corner with my chest and yelling “don’t hit me, don’t you ever fucking hit me” and I turned into a colossal asshole. \n\nWe were both in the wrong for our attitudes and actions. But she only sees my wrong. We’ve been in counseling for a few weeks to help resolve our communication issues and figuring out how to mourn our two baby’s appropriately. I feel like such a mess up. I feel so disgusted and ashamed of myself. I can’t bring myself to talk to a therapist because I feel like that’s saying somethings wrong with me, that I’m a mistake. I don’t know the logic behind it but I’m just scared to unearth some of the garbage from my past with my father. I also feel like I can’t talk to my wife about my anger. She knows it’s there, she calls it out. But I feel so stupid and small when I try explaining my feelings to her.\n\nI want to be a better husband. I want to be a not angry husband. I don’t want to be my dad.\n\n",

I respect my dad a lot. I don't know what it is about my mom. I love her a lot, but she really gets on my nerves. I tend to raise my voice at her. I don't know why... I say this like I don't know--It's obvious that it's my angry stuff, but WHY my mom?! I can manage my anger in public, with coworkers, with other students, friends, etc... but with my parents/mostly my mom, I can't. \n\nAt extreme situations, like in a big argument/fight, I pretty much yell at the top of my lungs. I really don't get it. Why my mom? Could it be because of something I saw as a kid? Something I experienced? I don't know. \n\nCan anyone give me some input here? Maybe something I can do to help with the management of my anger toward my mom?\n\nIf you guys have any questions--maybe you need to ask a question about my past, then just ask away. \n\nI appreciate all responses. Thank you, all!\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that when it comes to public stuff, I can get angry if someone purposely pisses me off (like maybe they did something that THEY KNOW pisses me off) or if someone is being annoying, I can hold in my anger for a really long time before blowing up. I dunno if this applies to every situation, but this has happened to me before in a classroom.\n\nEdit2: I would like to add one more thing. I play video games that are online/competitive. I get pissed sometimes from losing these games, but not to the point where I'm so angry that I yell. It just sorta gives me stress. When I'm stressed, I eat. I should also mention that I'm not living a healthy lifestyle (I don't know if my anger is making me stressed or if being stressed is making me angry) I think it's both. Anyway, yeah... I guess a professional would be the best bet here",

I hate the people who work at crematoria. they're so egotistical and from my experience they're narcissists who think they're important and help everyone and disregard the people they don't. Not everyone finds comfort in cremation. People need to understand that. Not everyone wants that. I have the misfortune that my sister was cremated by her adoptive mother. Basically, my mum's lifelong best friend and girlfriend, who was our second mother after our dad died, adopted my sister shortly before she died, and was in the process of adopting me. I can't say she's a narcissist because she wanted to help but it's not fair.\n\nShe says she cremated my sister because she was upset about her own sister being buried and didn't want me to go through that pain, and she loved my sister so much that she wanted to give her something more dignified and she wanted to make me feel comforted. Well, I'm not. Nothing I do with the ashes helps. Nothing. This woman getting me a \"pretty urn\" or sewing me a doll with the ashes in it in an attempt to make me feel better for my birthday (which just made me angry and upset on my birthday) doesn't help. My sister isn't close to me. I don't even know what to say, but it's not fair. She said she thought my sister would be afraid of the dark so didn't want her in the ground, but she knew she was terrified of fire too. It's not fair. I don't respect people who do this, I just think they're so disgusting, even if they want to help. It's not fair, and it's so insulting that my sister had to go through cancer and then got shoved in a furnace and had her adoptive mother turn her into something as ugly as she is. I hate it, and this lady isn't adopting me, I've tore up all the papers. It's so hard to forgive her and a large part of me doesn't want to. I can't think of anything else to say, it's just fucking unfair.\n\nI hate the woman so much. She keeps telling me all this shit like how I can \"talk\" to my sister, because she keeps saying her spirit is still here and all this shit. My dad is dead too and she thinks that since he's dead she can waltz in and be my second parent. I walked in on her in the bath the other day lathering up my mother and I mean, they're both physically beautiful but fuck, one is my actual mother, and the other I just hate so much, I don't want to see them naked together. Just fuck all this. Just looking at her makes me mad. I wish she'd die. Its not fair, its fucked up, I feel like I'm heading towards a mental breakdown, and I keep having dreams about my sister being cremated as well. Fuck them all, and fuck her for taking my real mother from me who I love so damn much. Now mum spends so much time with her, and I feel left out, and her friend, the fake mum keeps acting so fucking nice and I feel awful, like, it makes you feel like shit when someone wants to give you a hug or play animal crossing with you or bring you our to McDonald's and there's the awkward moment where you just have to be firm and mean and say no. I'm not letting her have a daughter, so she's not fucking having me. And she can stop calling herself a \"veteran\" while she's at it. My mum served 20 years in the navy and did five tours in the middle East. She basically worked three and a half years in a call centre for the air force.",

I say and do things that go beyond what people mean when they say \"she was mad, she didn't mean it.\" I do mean it, when that red haze settles over me. I genuinely want to hurt whoever it is I'm speaking to and I mean it with all my heart.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n If I try to hold it down and keep myself from flying into a rage, it physically HURTS. like I will cry and have shaking panic attacks if I keep myself from yelling and going nuts. It's like the anger is a monster inside of me and if I don't unleash it on someone else it starts to eat me instead. It doesn't go away either. Even if I wait an hour it will still be there waiting to be let out. Sometimes I even throw up from how it feels. \nBut if I do let the anger out on someone, even if they deserved it or I felt justified, when it's over I just feel worthless and shameful, the way someone does when they see how they acted when drunk. And that monster never stays gone. It will just come back another time when it needs to be fed again. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel hopeless, like I will never have control over this and I will never solve anything. Sometimes it feels good to lose my shit. Whenever it's happening, it feels necessary and right, like I need to do it--not only to feel better but to protect myself from emotional vulnerability. Just like a drug. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel completely broken down right now and I just wanted to know if any of that was at all something you guys could understand. I just feel alone with it.",

    "title": "How working in retail sales allowed me to permanently kill my extreme anger issues and transform into a completely different person",
    "selftext": "Good evening Reddit,\n\nI’ve been lurking on this sub for a while now in order to gain insight into how others deal with anger, and after some thought, I’d like to share my personal outlook on anger and my story of how I was able to conquer my own. Hopefully, some of you in my shoes may benefit from it.\n\nI won’t go into detail about my childhood and teenage years, but they were essentially shit. My formative years caused me to foster a deep-seated hatred and irrational anger to anything and everyone that posed (in my eyes) even a minuscule threat or challenge to me, and I became prone to giving up on things easily and throwing explosive temper tantrums.\n\nThis continued until about five years ago, when I got a job as a salesman in a furniture store, a position I’m still hanging with while I pursuing an online MBA.\n\nWorking in retail, especially in a position where you’re on some type of commission, is toughest when you hit a long string of customers that don’t buy anything.  It wouldn’t even be the fact that they wouldn’t buy, just the feeling in my mind that each non-buying customer was one step closer to me being out the door that drove me insane with rage. I was in a never-ending state of anger.\n\nOne day, after literally everything could have gone wrong in my life and I’d sold absolutely nothing in that pay period, I took everything out on my mother (verbally) and afterwards felt like the biggest piece of shit in the world. I decided then to try and be a better person and get ahold of my anger before I let it destroy my grades in college and my career.\n\nI began to practice what I now believe to be the most crucial factor in controlling one’s anger: patience.\n\nIn order to truly be successful in a retail sales job, you must unequivocally be patient with your customers. At my angriest, I would let that anger seep through and show on my face, and likely intimidate my customers (as I’m a 6’4 large frame guy), thereby losing me potential sales. \n\nHow I started out was controlling only my facial expressions, and trying to keep a smile or at least a neutral expression throughout the entire sales process with each customer. If something they said or did pissed me off, I’d take a deep breath and try to either strike up a new conversation with them, think of a song in my head, or just let my mind wander a bit. Anything for my brain to keep my mouth from frowning.\n\nMore money ended up coming in. As time passed, I’d find myself doing this outside of work with friends, family, and people I’d meet. I noticed people start to become more comfortable around me and even like me more.\n\nEventually, almost all of the irrational anger I’d had stored away since I was a little boy had gone. I found myself able to focus more on things I was passionate about, and not get frustrated with people as often. I’m not going to say I don’t still get frustrated, as I now have one of those nagging girlfriends, but when I do, it blows away almost instantly and I’m able to keep myself from lashing out.\n\n\nTL;DR The key to controlling your anger is actively practicing patience with others, even those that piss you off to no end. For those in retail sales, I recommend this approach. Hope this helps.",

Calm cool and collected. With that being said our client of the day is an old friend of my boss, so with my boss being busy I agreed to take on this new clients kitchen.\n\nA little more than halfway through the kitchen this client had other workers tearing down walls and renovating the rest of the house.

I agreed since he is a friend of my boss, someone who I consider a father figure and even family.\n\nA few days in, the client said he would pay me, and he ended up ducking out saying he needed to be somewhere etc. I didn’t think anything of it since I had his credit card and he trusted me with it to buy supplies for the rest of the job.\n\nThere was a minor issue with a wire I ran that had a staple in it, which I promptly fixed and I docked that hour out of my invoice. Because that’s fair.\n\nWhen I finished the rough of the job, (there is a rough and then there is a finish portion of the job) there was an issue with the electrical service that someone had taken care of it for temporary power, and before nyseg could be called, they came to disconnect the power because they considered it “stealing” instead of a temporary jump, which I don’t blame them for.\n\nNow the client is without power, his basement is flooding and he’s freaking out, so I decided to take on fixing his service which I got a permit for, the only problem is it took nyseg a week to come out and turn the power on, something out of my control. \n\nWell even though it wasn’t my fault this client didn’t give one single fuck and decided to get extremely pissed at me and would not let me finish the job I was hired to do. He stopped answering my texts/calls about getting paid for the work I did.\n\nI still to this day haven’t been paid a cent for all of the work I was blitzed for.\n\nI had to bother my boss to even ask why this guy won’t answer me, and this guy says “He’s a nice kid but there were a couple issues with the work and I didn’t know if I was paying for him to repair them.”\n\nNow I would have fixed any and all issues had I known. Instead I was barred from the job and all of the money I had coming my way.\n\nMy boss says I deserve the money and he is vouching for me, but I am so unbelievably pissed at how this turned out.

I didn't want to be friendless anymore, and the fact I had to do it and have fun while doing it pissed me off.

I even apologized to the teacher WHEN I LITERALLY DIDNT DO ANYTHING. my teacher even said \"but OP, you didn't do anything why are you apologizing?\"\n\nTW SUICIDE ATTEMPT MENTION BELOW\n\nalso, maybe if they just checked in on me, maybe I wouldn't have had near-suicide attempts!\n\ni remember multiple times as like 6-11 ish-year-old kid, I remember one time I grabbed my parents biggest knife and pointed it at my chest, but didn't do it because I heard my mom walking up\n\nthen there was the time I got a paper bag handle, made a noose out of it and tried to hang myself. it didn't work of course but wtf little me. \n\nthen there was that time I swallowed all of my curious George sleeping pills, which were all just placebo pills that were just sugar.\n\nall the times on my way home from school when I thought about throwing myself onto a very busy highway\n\ni only found out recently that those things aren't normal when my friends were talking about how one time they thought about driving their car off of a bridge.

I wanted to not be attracted to females and just live my life and be happy single and alone, but I just can't. I always have to feel attraction when I see someone attractive. I'm not particularly rude and have no problem taking rejection, I just hate myself when I can't take the shot and ask someone out. The reasons: In the past, someone took my interest in them the wrong way and their friends also shamed me. This was during my 20s, but this memory still haunts me. 2nd: I've been reading way too much about the #metoo movement that it makes me carefully examine someone to see if I were to ask them out if they are going to take it the wrong way, deterring me from pursuing relationships. Factors in this problem: 1. My mother died when I was 3. 2. Not only having autism, but being shy around women. 3. Being abused and mistreated by a few women living with my dad and brother when I was 9, but I know not all women are dangerous and mentally ill, but this experience and other experiences made it hard for me to trust women. I just want to die so I don't have to feel and relive these past experiences anymore. 4. My past stepmother and stepsister would always shame me and put me down. I actually get more pissed off at unwarranted criticism and I take praise as \"this person is just being nice\", from females. It's not the women's fault, and I'm not mad at them for what happened to me. I get overwhelmed when people say \"You'll find the right woman\", because a lot of other men heard the same thing and died before finding any woman. Their trying to make me feel better statement is unrealistic and sounds like they can predict the future, but I understand it's considered polite to say this. I can ramble on, but my mental health is full of problems. Mostly because of my relationship with my family and the fact I almost have no friends. \n\nHopefully when I'm 40, I can finally accept myself on this aspect and finally NOT CARE. I'll hopefully have a dog by then and it's just me and the dog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother one. My right shoulder is bothering the fuck out of me and I can't figure out how to fix it. Seeing massage therapists, chiropractors, even getting an MRI done paying some $$$$ for it, I still haven't found the solution yet. It gets painful and irritating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy right eye has some vision problems I can't figure out. I went to the eye doctor and they can't figure it out. Maybe I got a brain tumor? Yay. gotta shell out more $$$$\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a pretty negative person. That's hard for me to change because I don't like the world for the way it is. I who has a mental disability, has a hard time to adapt. Sure right now, I have a stable job, money saved up, no criminal record, and still driving my car, but who knows when that will end. Then I'll figure out what to do and what I will have to mourn about and lower my standards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm pushing myself to read books more. This post is a big rant about my mental health hindering my ability to enjoy life. I'm actually losing memory and getting more brain fog.",

I despise Russian TV and newspapers because they are spewing nothing more than a pure hatred towards everyone who’s “not with us”. \n\nYesterday I became a victim of that hatred. It was an ordinary morning, I was on my way to work and while I was on my way to subway station got a call from a friend living in Germany through skype and was having a small talk with him while continuing walking to the station. At this point, someone apparently heard me speaking in English and decided that I am a much-hated westerner. What happened next is simply beyond any reason or understanding. With no warning, I got punched right into my face. I have not seen who did it, the only thing I heard was “stupid Americans”. There was many people around and yet no one tried to neither assist me nor stop the assailant. The hit was so strong that it disoriented me for about 15-20 seconds, had one of my teeth broken and have a terrible black eye. By the time, I managed to gather myself the one who hit me blended with the crowd and vanished, pathetic coward who can only attack an unsuspecting opponent and then run.\n\nI now cannot look at anyone around without becoming angry, without hating all of them. In my eyes, all of them are nothing more than cowards basking in their own hatred towards the rest of the world. Animals who cannot even keep themselves from turning on each other. Ignorant fools eagerly consuming this hatred propaganda spewing on them from local “news” outlets. Those who’re proclaiming themselves to be “better than others” while in reality are little more than a violent mongrels.\n",

So I usually really need some little socialization here and there, and my mom is whom I've been able to open up to. But most of the time, her attention span is *so* short, she's always distracted by things and she has this tendency to suddenly insert off-topic things while I'm sharing something. For example: I'm venting about work and she suddenly 100% focuses and inserts this thing about my nephew that's totally unrelated then goes off from there, leaving me cut off. Sometimes midway I'm saying something, she inserts so suddenly and asks me to do things. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.\n\nWhat's more frustrating is that I think I'm slowly getting infected by her habit, and I super hate it! Why can't she just *wait* for me to finish before starting a different topic? It's literally *seconds.* Why does she have to drastically impatiently change topics literally the moment I stop talking. AND WHY THE HELL DOESN'T SHE UNDERSTAND WHY I WALK OUT EVERYTIME SHE DOES THIS. I've shown her how much I get frustrated by this, I've shared with her how I feel about this, but she just doesn't do anything! Today I've been extra stressed at work and I was about to vent about it when I was about to go have snacks at the kitchen but she literally cuts me off- like in a super sudden, instant, quick, strong way. The way she cuts me off isn't even the \"oh sorry to interrupt but can you get the thing for me?\" it's literally in a loud voice telling me to get the thing. Like holy shit, I have literally *no one* else to talk to on most days. Literally no one. I don't have tons of friends, most of them we have lives to deal with so I don't open up. My mom doesn't do anything at home and she can't even have the decency to not interrupt rudely?? I normally *just* boil inside but today it's gotten to the point that I threw stuff at the wall after locking my bedroom door because I was literally raging inside. I really want to stop feeling this way but holy shit is this so hard.\n\nI can't move out btw, because it's also not a common thing for our race (I'm asian) and I live in a third world country so the expenses are extra expensive and moving out is just not necessary. I just hate it everytime she does this and she *keeps* doing it like I have to expect it to happen to not get affected by it. If she doesn't do that, she looks literally everywhere like she's checking things *while* I'm talking. Literally short and rude attention span.

And when it’s all said and done it goes to the heart of 2 issues - I hate my father, and I hate my time wasted.\n\nI’m frightened I’ll drop dead of a heart attack at a young age because I can’t control my anger or process my emotions fast enough. Oh, and did I mention I hate my father. I think he’s scum of the earth, and feel as though I’m running into versions of him all over the earth.",

    "selftext": "Full disclosure thsi is long, im sorry i havent formatted it fantastically, but for context, I have had a pretty rough life, from homelessness to multiple different sexual assaults, abusive narcissistic step parent, general bullying. Mental health issues were an obvious consequence, I get very bad periods of depression and occasional manic spells not to mention suicide attempts which have put me in hospital before and lead to a diagnosis of bipolar type 2. \nI'm a generally very sweet person, I'm the person who laughs everything off, and I often do favours for people without wanting anything in return, this often leads to me being taken advantage of.\nWhen I met my partner 3 years ago I had just been r@ped and it resulted in a pregnancy, one that I was too traumatised to fix, i was offered a late term abortion by the time I realised but I was convinced out of it by my mum and partner. Meanwhile in the background my partners friend at the time (who now stalks me, I know my life is pretty bleak) was busy convincing my partner that I had fabricated the whole thing and was lying for attention, because of course that's what she would have done the psycho. \nMy partner was in a band at the time and I had offered to do some art for them for free, and the fall out of all this crazy making happened all around the time I was doing their art. I was traumatised homeless at the time (I was raped in homeless accommodation) and heavily pregnant, and my partner who had quite severe anger and substance abuse issues at the time had said that she'd beat me if I didn't \"confess\" that I \"hadn't actually been raped\" and too be honest my faun trauma response just made me go along with it because truthfully it was easier to pretend that she was right and I couldn't deal with the fall out at the time. While all this is going on the band kicks my partner out, but not before using my art to put on t shirts to sell, the art that I'd done for free while my partner was in the band. They didn't ask me if they could, and they didn't offer me any of the profits, and by this time they all thought I'd lied about being raped so they were pretty nasty to me. They essentially called me crazy and played the whole, \"legally you can't do much\" card. \n\nSorry that's a lot of context I know. Anyway this band have just released a new album, and they've written a song about having bipolar. Now I don't want to say if the front man does or does not have bipolar, but given the way he treated me I find it pretty rich that he's acting like a mental health advocate. After all I've been through i find it so incredibly stupid that it's this specific thing that pisses me off but somehow I just cannot get over it. And truthfully I frighten myself with the vivid fantasies that I get of homicide etc. I know that it's entirely unreasonable. I'm not a mean person. I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but I'm so so angry. They dragged me all across r/legal and treated me like a Karen for something they clearly did wrong and it scares me how angry it makes me. Especially considering there are people who are far more worthy of my hatred than some silly local band who screwed me out of merch money. \nI'm scared that if I see them I'll snap, or have a break down, or worse, hurt someone. And I don't want to be seen as that crazy bitch anymore. It's not fair. \n\nI don't know maybe this post itself makes me sound like a crazy bitch, if so let me have it reddit. \nBut if anyone has any advice, or even anything similar to share of really appreciate it. It would just be nice to not feel crazy for once",

I don’t wana go into details of things I’ve done in the past but in my last relationship, things got really toxic for us..we were together for almost 5 years. I’m not making excuses for myself but a few times I did turn physical. Like slapped him..nothing ever like full blown fist fights but I deff had my hand on his face in so much anger and he’s got physical with me, sometimes it was acting out in defensive but once it was just pure anger at him. He was pretty much a drunk that I was in denial he was that bad and I should of walked away but we had a baby together a year and a half ago, so last year we were raising him in an apartment and I was so exhausted and dealing with a huge chronic pain that came bk that just made me in so much pain that I didn’t even feel like me and he was drunk a lot and turned really mean. I got so angry at the situation, it turned me into a really ugly girl that did some not so pretty things. Anyway I’m not making excuses, I no I suppress my anger and when it comes out it’s deadly. Even if someone treats me badly first, I should learn to walk away. Which I did in June, I moved with my parents which is a toxic situation in its self but at least better. I just realized that this was prob not gona get better and I need to do what’s right for my son. It was way to toxic and I was slowly turning I to someone I didn’t like. Anyway idn I needed to write this somewhere because I’ve been working on myself a lot, trying to find a peace of mind. Find healthy ways to channel anger , learn to love myself but Something keeps telling me in my head I’m a bad person. I feel like people see this sweet kind girl and then I think about certain past actions and I feel like a fraud. I really am not fake tho when it comes to being a sweet person, i care so much and love so deeply, but sometimes my mind gets super unbalanced and I’m not sure if Its a chemical imbalance or just have a lot of suppressed anger or both and it makes me hate myself. I don’t no how to right my wrongs even if I keep my anger in check forever, it doesn’t erase the past. It makes me feel unworthy of love and I just wana give up a altogether. I don’t no how to forgive myself.\n\nI know this is a ramble. I just am wondering if. I’m a good person or bad person. I feel lost and a lone. I just don’t want to feel like I’m fooling people. Whenever I am being me and living in my heart, I always have voices whispering in my head that I’m not this person and it shows me my past actions where I acted in anger and I start to believe that’s me. I really have tried to reflect if the sweet kind caring girl is really me and of course there are times it’s over done but overall I don’t ever feel like I’m being fake when I’m kind, it what’s feels authetic to me. I hate when I’m mean and angry and lash out, it really makes me disgusted in myself.",

Compound that with the fact that if I yell even a little bit and she shuts down for 20 minutes minimum, won't say a word. So there isn't much incentive to stop myself halfway through, even if I could. Not to mention we fight so infrequently (ironically due to good communication) that there aren't many opportunities to practice such things.\n\nI imagine it's a long shot, but does anyone have any tips?

Growing up my family was poor so any free time we had my dad, brother and I dedicated our extra time to fixing and selling cars. My dad was very strict we had to earn any fun time we wanted, and we rarely got to hang out with friends. It felt like he was more of a boss than a dad. Me and my brother would compete with each other to earn his approval to the point we're we were more rivals than brothers. He was always critical of us and our work to the point where we never felt good enough. Not to mention the insults and name calling we endured. Now a man of 30 I see myself becoming him. I was always overly critical of my wife, son, and her teenage sisters that lived with us. I rarely ever showed affect towards them and the stresses of the world constantly had me in a bad mood and taking it out and them. She begged me to get help and I brushed it off. Untill our last fight was the last straw and they moved out within a few weeks.\n\nMonths later I'm alone, working on myself and reflecting. I'm grateful my ex lets me see my son when I want and am determined to break the cycle of anger. I've been reading anger management and parenting books along with my counseling. And it seems to have helped. My parents have seen the error of their ways and apologize constantly for how they treated us. I forgive them, they were just doing the best they could with who they were. I see a change in them too. They're more patient, understanding, and loving with my son than they were with us. I'm also seeing improvement in myself. I stop myself and respond instead of react in the face of frustrations and anger. Unfortunately it costed me losing my best friend and most important person I've ever know. There's is hope for change, you just have to find a good enough reason. Mine being my son. Good luck guys!",

He punched a wall once too.\n\nHe has NO patience at all and I mean none, I love him but sometimes I'm embarrassed to go in public with him because he can be so rude to random people like cashiers/customers/waiters/etc and I always feel so awkward and ashamed of his behavior, he can really be mean. \n\nFor example, today was not a good day. My parents are staying in a hotel and my mom was talking about the musty smell in the room and he goes \"What? What do you want to do now, move?!\" really rudely, and has been mean to her all day. It's parents' weekend at my college (I'm a freshman). We went out to brunch and halfway through I notice he's looking at me and he goes \"You tired?\" and I said no, kind of laughed a bit and said I hate when people say I look tired because it makes me feel like something looks wrong on my face or something, and he got PISSED, rolled his eyes said whatever and I jokingly told him to stop thinking he wasn't actually upset. I didn't think anything was wrong but he wasn't talking to me, and when we got back to the hotel he seemed off so I said \"what's wrong?\" and he said \"don't ask me what's wrong you know exactly what you did, I'm tired of being disrespected when I do everything for you I'm tired of it\" along with some other pretty harsh stuff, I asked him what I said that upset him and he told me to stop being dumb and figure it out. At this point I started tearing up because I hate when he does this and I just left and went outside. Normally my mom doesn't stick up for me but she followed me outside and we spent the rest of the day together and she apologized that he was being like that and that she didn't even know what I did either.\n\nI still hear him being nasty to my mom now all the way from the bathroom. I know it really upsets her and she keeps asking him not to get mad at her and he just says \"I'm not mad\" in the shortest, angriest tone.\n\nHe can also hold a grudge like no other and will probably not talk to me for days.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm an only child, I'm in the honors program at my college and very involved there, I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, etc, and I try my very best to treat my parents right. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough for him even though I'm always trying to be. This is upsetting me to the point where I feel sick.\n\nWhat should I do? ",

She has a short fuse and *anything* can piss her off. It's happened since I was a child, and tbh I grew up being more afraid of her than affectionate. I've had multiple talks about how she makes me feel throughout the years but it's been met with annoyance (*\"ugh you're just sensitive\"*), an excuse (*\"I didn't know\" / \"I only say these things because I care\")* downright dismissal, or it's due to external factors such as work stress. I've even suggested therapy and she broke down crying in denial that she needs therapy. ***I'm currently in therapy*** to combat my own internal issues with anger. \n\nTo be really honest, I'm at my wit's end. Living with an angry person is emotionally, mentally, and spiritually draining. There are times where I do feel she uses her anger as a weapon to get her way with me/others. I bend to her whims and wishes to prevent the blowup that would possibly spark over the littlest of things. I do take into account of her upbringing (repeating cycles of being raised by yelling/screaming) and issues over the years with my dad (they're relationship was toxic at best, abusive at worst). I get it, I do empathize. However, at the same time my empathy is running low and tip-toeing around someone almost all of my life is getting old. When someone refuses to see the problem, or at least *try to change*, then what is there left to do? Believe me, I've gone no contact with my mother before due to sitaution that was intense. Our \"no contact\" break was brief since not only family, but ***her friends*** swooped in on the situation guilt tripping me to talk to her since she's my mother after all. I've tried having a mediator during a disagreement but it only made things worse.\n\nPersonally, I'm done, but how do I bring up not wanting to be around her anymore without the possibility of a blow up?",

The world would be better without my horrible toxicity. I guess I see myself as a lost cause, forced to continue the cycle of anger issues from my dad and his dad before him. Thank you to everyone who reads this, I don't think I can handle the shame of talking about this with someone I love. I need someone to know that deep down I'm a piece of shit, and that I know I'm a piece of shit.",

    "title": "My anger is hurting my marriage",
    "selftext": "I'm sorry for the long post and appreciate anyone who's able to get through it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnger is something I've always struggled with. I did not learn healthy anger management and expression from my parents. I've always been very sensitive and had a fragile ego. As a child, I would cry often. As a teen, I would scream and yell. I lost friends because of my anger and the friends I held onto still called me out on my anger often. In college, I committed myself to working on my anger and to not take things so personally. My anger definitely improved, but still came out at times (e.g., when drinking). Over time, I realized that my anger was often the manifestation of untreated anxiety and depression. I took steps to take better care of my mental health and saw a lot of progress. Many of my old friends who knew my angry side have made comments like \"when you used to be angry\" or \"you don't get angry anymore like you used to.\" Nowadays, I believe nearly anyone who knows me now and did not know me before would not describe me as any angry person, but actually fairly level-headed and not easily upset - although I think nearly all of them would still describe me as anxious and stressed. I'll take that over angry any day. When I do get angry or sensitive with friends, I'm pretty good now at recognizing that I'm being ridiculous and owning up to it and talking it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically the only people who still see my sensitivity come through in a significant way and still see me get really angry are my family - especially my wife. My wife and I met when my anger management was in a good place. We worked for the same organization. She saw the occasional argument with someone, but it was nothing out of the ordinary given the nature of our job. She saw me get stressed and anxious and I was fairly open about some of my mental health struggles and we were good at talking things out. When we started dating, things were good, but my anger started to come back. I had started grad school and working toward my Ph.D. and my anxiety and depression were at an all time high. In addition, the \"honeymoon\" phase of the relationship started to wear off and we started to bicker more. As my mental health worsened, my anger came back with a force and it was almost always directed at her. Nearly every argument or moment of petty bickering turned into a full-flung rager. I am not a physically aggressive person and would never try to physically hurt my wife, but I would slam doors and can do other physical things that may still be scary or shocking for someone else to experience. I am also very verbally aggressive. I yell, I curse, I say mean things. It got to a point where my wife told me that I scared her when I got angry, that I got angry often, and that she felt like she was stepping on egg-shells whenever she made a comment about me or something I did. I realized at the time that I was returning to my old, angry, depressed, anxious self that I thought I had outgrown. I still had my anger under control around other people, but I think my poor mental health was still effecting my work and social lives in other ways. My wife and I discussed what could be done about it and I started going to therapy, began taking medication, and took other steps to take care of my mental health (exercise, eating healthier, better sleep habits, finding better coping strategies, etc.). Things improved again. We still had out arguments and bickering, but far fewer escalated to the severity from before and I was getting better with my coping, talking it out, and not taking everything so personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow here we are again. I'm in the last year of grad school and I'm in the final stages of my dissertation. I'm looking for post-docs or other jobs for next year. At the start of the pandemic, things were good. Now we live in a new town that we don't like and where we have no friends outside of work colleagues. We enjoy our current jobs and coworkers, but that's about it. My wife and I were doing well supporting each other when we first moved here. We had very few arguments and were spending a lot of good quality time together. However, it feels like something changed in the last few weeks or so. I went from feeling pretty good mentally most days and keeping my mental health in check to feeling like absolute shit. I had about a week off after Christmas, where things really came to a head and I had what I can only describe as a week long panic attack. I was not maintaining good hygiene, my sleep schedule was awful, I could not bring myself to do anything work related, I was completely incapable of doing any work on my dissertation, I was spending basically all of my time in my office by myself, and I was spending very little time with my wife. I felt like a failure of a husband. I did eventually talk to my wife about how I was feeling (which was obvious to her) and she was very supportive and worked hard to help calm me down and bring me back to earth. Over the next few days, I started to feel a lot better, especially as I started going back into work and not just working from home. I feel mostly back to normal except one thing... I still struggle spending time with my wife and I have been so high strung and mean towards her. She has been making so many efforts to make me happy and keeping our home together (because God knows I'm not carrying my weight with home maintenance) and trying to take care of our relationship. But I have felt empty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel unhappy and numb almost all of the time when I'm home. It's at the point where she's asked me if I love her anymore. I do love her, but for some reason I'm struggling to feel anything other than annoyance and frustration and I don't know why. She has done so much for me and for us and all I've done is be a burden and an ungrateful prick. I really tried over the last couple of days to be more present to her and not be avoidant or rude, and things seemed a little better. But then last night happened. I was very exhausted from work, but felt good. We sat down together in our living room to talk. I asked her how her day was, but when she started to talk my mind started to drift and she said she felt like I wasn't listening and she hasn't felt heard or supported lately. Just like that, boom, I'm pissed. I start going off on how she's being unfair and unappreciative of what I've done and how I did nothing wrong and she's being nitpicky and all these things. She gets upset and tells me she was just trying to explain how she's been feeling and that she needs a little more support. Now here I am, the guy who has been a mess and overall huge pain in the ass the last few weeks and who she did her best to support, but when she asks for the same in return I just completely disregard it all and treat her like shit. We eventually take a moment and I calm down and apologize and try to make up for it. Things get a little better, but then she asks me to put new sheets on our bed while she finishes up some laundry. I start to do so when she comes in to help and laughs at me because I was putting the sheets on wrong. My response \"Can you please SHUT THE FUCK UP?\" She's speechless and I just feel so irrationally angry. She asks me if I'm joking or going to apologize and I just give some half assed apology and walk out of the room. I don't know why I reacted that way... in my head I knew she was just teasing and it wasn't a big deal. I wanted to say something like \"oh shut up\" in a playful way, but instead it turned into something so mean. And even though I knew I didn't mean to talk to her that way and I don't know why I did, I still got so defensive and left the room. It's like I had \"calmed down\" from our earlier argument, but there was some rage still churning inside me that hadn't gone away. Obviously she was really mad and upset this morning, but I did nothing to make up for it and we basically avoided each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like my marriage is falling apart and it's all my fault. My wife is a saint who does so much to make me feel loved and appreciated. I used to do that, but now any effort or appreciation I show is so half-assed in comparison. I know I love her and my life would fall apart without her, but I feel like if I don't make a change then I may lose her. I've been trying to reflect on what's happening and consider ways to manage it. Part of me thinks it's because my social life is basically non-existent because of the pandemic and living in a new area and I'm someone who enjoys spending time with friends. I think that's why I feel good at work and so empty at home. I also think part of it is that we're somewhat religious, but haven't been to church since the start of the pandemic. Outside of religious/spiritual fulfillment, I feel church was a time where I could also reflect on things and gain perspective, which is something I think has really been lacking lately in my life. I'm also wondering if I need to start going to therapy again or get my medication adjusted. I also have completely regressed in my stress/anxiety coping skills and basically just hang out alone in my office playing computer games or watching videos. I want to work on those things, but I really want to make sure I'm addressing the root cause of why I've been treating my wife so poorly and figure out some ways where to \"fix\" myself, but also help her feel loved and supported and confident in my feelings toward her. Any advice or suggestions would be really appreciated. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR: I have shitty mental health and my ability to manage it has ebbed and flowed over the years. I've been really bad at it lately, but the place it's affecting me the most is in my marriage and I've been treating my wife like shit despite all of the efforts she's made to help support me. She doesn't feel loved or supported right now and for some reason I just get so angry with her and feel irritable around her almost all of the time these days. I feel like a failure of a husband and that I'm causing my marriage to fall apart. I know I still love her and want to figure out how I can better myself and find ways to show her that I love her and want to support her. Any advice or recommendations are welcome.",

    "selftext": "I am an extremely angry person and it’s affecting my hopes for happiness and my health\n\nI’m 25. I work with a therapist weekly, and I’m trying very hard to understand how to be a calm, easy going person. But *everything* makes me angry. The littlest inconveniences make me feel like I could hurl a brick through a wall. I try my best to keep it inside so people don’t think of me like this, but it doesn’t always work. I feel like a black sheep amongst my friends, I’m not at the same stage in life as most of them even though I’m working hard to get there and I feel like a failure. That makes me incredibly angry. I never feel understood by just about anyone in my life. Most of the things that make me happiest in life are things that no one I know enjoys or ever wants to connect about, and I feel isolated. I used to be in touch with my emotions, but now most of the ones I feel turn to anger before too long and it almost feels inhuman. I feel like I care more about most people in my life much more than they do about me, and like I would go to further lengths to show that than just about any of them would unless it was convenient. I feel like this anger spiral has ruined my ability to have romantic relationships, something I used to be quite happy with myself in some years ago. That makes me feel so incredibly lonely, not to mention the one person I think I could feel that way for now seems to be uninterested in that sort of relationship. I want to stop being angry, angry at myself for being anxious or sad or insecure or depressed or envious of the much happier people I know. I want to feel considered for and confident in myself enough to just be happy. I want to feel loved, by someone that doesn’t seem to feel obligated, and for all of my weird flaws and quirks. I like myself to an extent, but I don’t feel very likable from an outside point of view. I’m missing all of these feelings and the stewing anger it creates at every little thing in my life feels like it’s ironically pushing me further from who and where I want to be. Not to mention that I think it has started to become genuinely detrimental to my heart and blood pressure, which is terrifying since that’s already an issue in my family. I just want to be happy. I want to not care about the little things, the inconveniences. I want to stop seeing the worst in people, and letting the things that piss me off about them fester. I want to stop being immensely bothered by things that I won’t even think about in a day. I want to be able to let it go when people don’t see things my way instead of being so angry that I never feel like I’m on the same page, and not thought of. I want someone to want to be with me, someone who really feels like they’re just excited to spend time together. I’m tired of being lonely and looking down on myself. I’m tired of constantly trying to put everyone before myself, and the feeling such rage when no one else thinks about anyone but themselves. I want to be at peace, and be healthy. I just want to be happy with me, not furious at everything that I’m not and everything I can’t control, and have that be enough to help me move in the right direction. \n\nThanks to anyone for reading.",

    "selftext": "          I am a 12 year old girl with a 20 year old sister. Although my hatred towards her has sprouted recently, she has physically and emotionally abused me since I was about 4. \n\n          When I was younger i was blind to her manipulation and desire for attention. She would force me to be a flyer for her cheer stunts for hours on end, not letting me have breaks or refusing to give my injuries attention when she would drop me.\n\n             But things got worse when she got older. She was very possessive of her belongings, and still is to this day. I vividly remember that I was using her straightener and when she found out, she proceeded to burn my arm with it until it started to bleed. My mother never believed that she did it and thought that i did it for attention.\n\n             For a few years after that she figured out a loophole. If she was nice to me I would do favors for her. So she would make me scratch her back for an hour everyday for a year in order to get her broken iPhone 4.\n\n              Once again the favors progressed. Like taking a photo for her fake ID and hiding her alcohol from my mom saying it was juice or photos for her college applications, and even though I knew the truth I wasn’t smart enough to see through her act.\n\n            When she went to college she would facetime me everyday, hiding her true personality. I saved up for months to buy her a $100 dollar perfume only for her to roller her eyes at me and scoff on christmas day.\n\n            I’ve hated her ever since then and never fell for her manipulative tricks. But i thought it would be easy to ignore her since she has college. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened and i’m stuck with her.\n\n         The first few days were the most chaotic. My other sister eva and i were baking cake pops and isabella (the first sister) came in and took her phone. When eva tried to get it back in the middle of their fight isabella punched her in the nose and eva was bleeding all over the ground and almost passed out from the pain/blood loss. \n\n            I called the police for her and isabella lied to the police saying she was 17 and did not punch her in the nose. My mom backed her up because she didn’t want isabella’s career to fail since she is currently at yale for neuroscience.\n\n            She has been careful since then and has only used language but she really knows how to get under my skin. She belittles me everyday saying i’m fat and ugly, and that i’m not smart enough to go to yale like her. \n\n           She takes my clothes and says “what are you going to do about it” and pushes me (which isn’t really abuse i guess) and when i push her back she yells for my mom. \n\n             Lately she revealed that my family has a groupchat trying to get me into counseling and when they KNOW my sister is the main reason i sob almost every night, they added her into that and give her my personal information to belittle me even more.\n\n           She says she wants me to kill myself with a smile on my face and I just smile back because i hate when people know i’m sad. I never knew the effect of bullying until now. I always thought that it would never affect me because i have thick skin, yet she knows how to do it.\n\n              Since she was the only sibling i ever hung out with, she stole my personality and applied it to herself. Whenever i talked to my siblings they think i copied her personality when i was the one who created it. So they make fun of me and use that in out arguments and isabella just laughs.\n\n             When i stopped talking her she started to develop a personality of her own, and it is the most obnoxious one i have ever seen. Her voice changed to a high pitched annoying squeaky voice and her laugh is so bitter and evil.\n\n              My sibling now side with her and make fun of me with her, but behind her back they say they hate her. Apparently they say they are scared of her in person but i don’t believe them. \n\n             This might be controversial but i genuinely want her to exit my life completely in any way shape or form. If that means death then so be it. I don’t wish it upon her but if it happens i wouldn’t be mad. I have felt suicidal ever since she came home for spring break and i have been contemplating ending it all. It always ends up in me distracting myself from the secret pain, but one day i might actually do it. My trust issues prevent me from going to counseling. But i just don’t know what to do about it. \n\n            Please don’t bash me i’ve been through a lot. Also if anyone could let me know how to talk to someone about my issues without feeling embarrassed since when eva told my mom she  was suicidal she didn’t care please let me know because i’m afraid a counselor will snitch to my family. \n\n              I would also like to say this isn’t a rant i am genuinely talking about my problems since no one else in my life will listen and i don’t\nhave any friends to talk to because they are all not serious or known as “school friends.” Please don’t delete this.",

    "selftext": "All the people in my family had no resistance to hitting children. Whenever the children didn't follow their parents' rules, the adults would hit them. In these scenarios, the parents were visibly angry, and felt justified in hurting their own flesh. They never apologized for their abuse; also, they never thought to visit a counselor for their anger.\n\nMy father and his brothers were soccer players. They always yelled and cursed the opponents during soccer games, and there were a few instances where they escalated into fighting. No one seemed to worry about the physical danger; they only felt the desire to prove themselves superior in strength. When they were watching soccer on their television, their screams of disapproval were directed at the TV.\n\nHonest accidents were also a trigger for these volatile men. Spilling drinks, or similar, was quickly met with scorn and condemnation. If the man was feeling especially petty, these accidents might warrant a smack to the child. Seemingly, my family had no issue with expressing anger. Apparently, hitting another human out of anger is reasonable; however, hitting a cushion is completely unacceptable.\n\nI was twenty two years of age when my parents involuntarily admitted me into a psychiatric ward. Immediately before being incarcerated, I was punching my mattress with sheer anger and frustration. My mom recommended that I visit a therapist. I complied because I wanted to free myself from the mental strain that I was feeling. She drove me to the hospital, and told me that someone would consult me there.\n\n My mom told a nurse that I wanted to burn down my parents' house. When I was angry, I did proclaim such a sentiment. My previous behavior, included with my seeking of therapy, would suggest that such a remark was only said in vain. I had no recent history of violent behavior. She also told the nurses about my previous suicidal thoughts. After a few hours of waiting, the hospital staff told me that I had to be sent to a detention facility, for a minimum of one week. According to them, I was a danger to society, and to myself. Oh, what was the reason for my initial anger? I found out, through my preteen cousin, that my grandma had been physically abusing her grandchild.\n\nWhen I was about six years old, my father hit me, and forced me into a restroom . I have witnessed a relative be dragged off into a room, to be beat by his father. I've seen children get screamed at, hit on their ass, and pulled my their arms, like some irrelevant rag doll.\n\nThe abusive people in my family DO NOT want to be exposed; that is why they had to lock me away. They vehemently resist any judgment that may be directed towards their abuse; because, they know they are responsible for damaging the lives of many innocent children. They have no problem with abusing kids, but if you show emotions towards that abuse, they will sent you to crazy camp, to shut you up. \n\nThese people don't care about me; they never did. They didn't want me to heal, for my own sake. They are committed to shutting down opposition in order for their crimes to be hidden, and to continue assuming the role of evil; without consequences.\n\nI left my family. I haven't seem them in one year. They refused to admit they're abuse, and they refused to continue engaging me in this vital conversation. If you were abused, and your abuser claims to be sorry, the conversation does not take one hour. The conversation should last years. The admitting of wrong, and they change towards peace, is a lifelong journey; it requires dedication from all parties. \n\nMy advice; get angry, and get talking; not over petty bullshit, but over the perpetration of evil that has existed and flourished since our ancestors first took breath.\n\nDon't let them silence you.",

    "selftext": "Recently, one of my best friends, who was honestly more of a sister than anything else, recently passed suddenly in the night. I’ve known her for over 11 years and it was, and still is absolutely heartbreaking. We met at age 4. And we’ve grown into different friend groups, but we told eachother everything. We were family. Anyways, the first day I came back to school after she passed, a girl who I already had issues with walked up to the table. She claimed that she was best friends with said friend who passed away, let’s call her G, and the girl who came\nup to the table B. G, and everyone that knew her knew that G hated B. So B coming up and saying that really upset me. But she’s selfish so I wasn’t surprised. Then she mentioned how her “boyfriend”(she wasn’t with him, she stood him up and stalked him, convinced they were in love) just broke up with her. Her exact words were “G was my best friend! I’m so upset, but do you wanna know what’s worse? P(let’s call the guy P.) broke up with me!” And I took a few seconds to process what she said. “You wanna know what’s worse?” Worse. How is your fake little boyfriend “dumping” you worse than someone’s death? I needed to walk away and come back later or I would have hurt her. I have never been as angry as I was in that moment. I went over to another table; and told my friend what just happened. I was so angry I made my friend cry because she thought I was upset with her. I needed to leave school that day because if I didn’t I genuinely don’t know what would have happened. I wanted to go up to B and tell her she’s a narcissistic brat, I wanted to tell her about how every single person she speaks to talks about her behind her back and hates her. I wanted to hurt her, both physically and mentally. I wanted to humiliate her. I still do, whenever I see her. But I never even say a word. I’ve never experienced this much anger towards someone.

I feel wave of heat in my limbs and in my face, I clench my jaw and I feel like screaming, like kicking the door until it shreds. BUT I CANT . I can’t because doors are fucking expensive, because the people I live with would get mad at me and because I’m not in my house. So what do I do? Well complaining in Reddit is one thing, but I also hit myself really hard. I hit my legs because that’s the part of my body that can endure the best a blow. I hit over and over again until the pain feels like a relieving sensation. It hurts but it hurts so good. Of course I also feel like beating the hell out of people, specially if I’m mad with someone specific. But again, I CANT because OF COURSE I CAN T you can t just go and hit whoever you re pissed off with. Believe me, I WISH I COULD. \n\nSometimes I like to fantasize about the day I have my own house. My dream would be to have a room prepared to be the target of my violence. I would have a boxing bag, fat chunks of wood to cut them with an ax, a baseball bat to hit the walls and who knows what else. Maybe a poster of my worst enemy and some darts lol. \n\nMy chest still hurts because of the anger I experienced a while ago but after writing this I’m A LITTLE better.\n\nThank you for reading i guess...??????",

    "selftext": "I was NOT baited into a fight!! There is me articulating that story and trying to reinforce this behavior in myself.\n\nSo there's this guy. And he's got a major attitude problem. He really tries to pick fights. Like, at the Christmas function we were playing scattergories and he scribbles on to the actual prompt cards, which in and of itself is an honest mistake, although he blamed me for not clarifying that he was supposed to write on the scratch papers that I handed him. But hey that's fixable. I was a little frustrated though because these were cards that my family had used for the last fifteen years. So I was a touch rustled. But afterwards when we explained that it was he was like \"it's more special because I wrote on it\" and proceeded to sign the other side of it. This frustrated me more. But hey it happens. I could fix it, all I had to do was photo copy another of the prompt cards, cut it to size, and tape the replacement in place. Later we were playing codenames, he was codemaster and kept giving extra info to his team. Kept reacting before they confirmed a guess, gave them feedback as they discussed options. And that was frustrating. But then when we called him out on it, he started freaking out and said we were telling him to be an emotionless robot and stuff. And it's like... Huh, you're not fun to be around. He kept pressing and went after me saying that I cared too much about the game. And then proceeded to make fun of how my face turns red when I am angry. But on that's fine. Christmas wraps up. I saw him again at a party today. We have a group playing scattergories. He says that he wrote on the cards again and I go \"dude what the fuck.\" I'll admit, not my best move, it slipped past my gaurd. And he went after it, started telling me how saying what the fuck was grounds for getting punched in the face, and how he's \"letting me go.\" I fucked up with my slip of the tongue, but then I stopped and thought through what would happen if we got into a fight here. It'd cause a celebration to be ruined and it'd reflect poorly on my family. And my middle sister called the guy out and told him to stop trying to start a fight, and hearing her stand up for me (we don't get along too well) just reminded me more: this wasn't a fight worth having. So I just got back to the game and focused on it. Even as he made fun of me for turning red. Even as he goaded me for not making eye contact (I was trying to stay calm.) I was able to not drop any snaps or mean comments. And things calmed down. I am used to intense feelings of anger, I used to snap all the time. But not this time, I just held my tongue and stayed calm. I am really proud of that. Like, it reminded me of a lot of my favorite heroes and like how they'd say there are things worth fighting for, and how sometimes it's okay to let the arrogant spit on you. This felt like a situation where bowing my head felt right. I shouldn't have snapped when I did, but I'm proud that I didn't rise to any bait after that.",

I was kind of hoping someone with some anger management skills would give me tips at how to ignore these things, or if other people get mad about the same things.

I probably really do have anger issues but one thing I absolutely cannot stand is when people ask questions that I literally think are “stupid” questions because they either have blatantly obvious answers or are just plain unnecessary and lack substance. I also can’t stand small talk because there is no goal or motive or point to get across. \nExample of a question with an obvious answer: (when someone clearly sees you doing something and asks you if you are doing that thing) Clearly making something to eat. “You making something to eat?” Clearly left the light on in the kitchen right in front of everyone. “Who left the light on in the kitchen?” Like stfu you know the answers, why make me open my mouth and say em? Especially this week when I’m missing my wisdom teeth and my whole head hurts.\n\nI also can’t keep control of myself when people point obvious things out to me like I’m 5 years old. Like just walking up behind me while I’m washing clothes and telling me for no fucking reason to be sure to put detergent in. WTF I AM NOT A VEGETABLE I CAN REMEMBER TO PUT DETERGENT IN A WASHING MACHINE. It’s so frustrating because whatever their rhyme or reason behind it, it just makes me feel socially obligated to explain some shit to them that I don’t want to explain.

The second was from my cousin when she wouldn't listen to me when my grandpa was ready for us to get pick up after school and was making fun of me. I got really mad at her and grabbed and dragged her to the car. I was 9 at the time. \n\nI realized I need to do something about this after all the same stories of me being the \"angry kid\" and now known as the \"angry man\".\n\nAt the very same school, I had a bully that would never stop picking on me when I told him to stop.

I never really learned to stick up for myself unless I got physical or got in that person's face.

    "title": "I'm so angry about my exes affair that ended our marriage",
    "selftext": "So, a bit of background. I had been with my ex (D) for 10 years, we were married and had a daughter together after 5 miscarriages. I built my life around him completely, and while we had our struggles they were always manageable. I had caught him cheating before (pictures/videos/kissing/sexting) but always on the lower scale and whilst it was hard, we always got past it.\nThe woman in question (C) was a very close friend of his, I didn't like her much to begin but he pushed me to be friends with her, kept saying it would mean so much to him if we could get along together etc etc. After I said to him we didn't have hardly anything in common he gave the reason that she had experienced miscarriages but didn't have any female friends to talk to about it and so he thought it would be good support for us both to be able to talk openly about our losses.\nThings had been getting a bit intense in the lead up to C's wedding (she had stated numerous times that she didn't want to marry her partner but didn't want to be alone more and so would marry him if nothing else came along, we told her over and over that it was horrible but thought she must love him to stay and he is a great guy). C kept making jokes about moving in with us and us all being in a relationship together, she could be D's 2nd wife etc etc. Eventually things came to a head on his birthday where she asked D to leave me for her, and when he said no she told him if he didn't tell me they'd been having an affair on and off for 8 years she would say he had sexually assaulted her.\nNeedless to say I left D and rebuilt my life and my daughters life, we maintain a manageable coparenting relationship so my daughter doesn't suffer but nothing beyond that honestly. I've moved past the aspect of the cheating and affair with him because he lost everything in the fallout, moved back with his parents and saw our daughter less due to not living together, which I know has been really really hard on him. I have a new partner and my life is overall just better in every way.\nHowever, I spoke to C's partner about it all and they got married, he found it hard but had committed so tried to move past it. He's a great guy and really sweet so I deliberately havent done any form of nuclear revenge essentially for his sake (we were friends before this). But I'm really struggling with the fact that there's been no consequences at all for C. She still got married to a great guy, she still got what she wanted which was me and D broken up, she still goes day to day and no one knows that she created all this destruction with D on our lives. Some days it makes me so angry I could just explode that she has no real life consequence to being such a horrible person. I know her parents are very important within the church and I've been tempted to tell them about it all but that's causing them harm which I don't feel is fair, and it feels petty to tell everyone about the affair now that we've moved past it but I just can't squash this intense anger of injustice that C and D just destroy mine and my daughters life then she moves on.\n\nHow do I get past it and stop feeling this constant rage??",

    "selftext": "I am so fucking pissed. My entire life has been so shit and I’m trying my hardest not to get angry with those who don’t deserve it but I can’t help it. \nI’m 20 now and I thought my days of experiencing shit were over. But it’s never over.\nI grew up in a household with an abusive dad who never hesitated to beat me whenever he was upset. He did this all the time without mercy for 10 years of my life. It fucked me up and made me a very rough kid.\nLuckily one day we finally left him for good but the shit didn’t stop there. Because we left him, I lost everything my toys, my clothes, sentimental things all gone. But that wasn’t all. I had to stay at one of my mums friends places and they were just the worse. Everyone was so busy tending to my mom and sisters that I had no one to talk to. I couldn’t speak to my mum for days. When I voiced my frustration and threw a tantrum. \nThey would scream at me and sometimes hit me. Like I was the problem. They called me a shit son and said that mum could easily get rid of me and that I was lucky. Exactly how was I lucky?\nAfter a year staying at a safe house we finally found a home but I wasn’t doing so great. I got expelled from my Christian school for apparently being too difficult to handle. I thought adults and teachers were there to help. Apparently not.\nI tried my hardest after that to be a better kid and it was so hard. My mums friends would still give me shit for the way I acted but I still tried to change. Even my mums boyfriend at the time was such an asshole. Constant verbal harassment from this stranger who only wanted to get in my mums pants. Thankfully she broke up with him a few years later.\n\nAfter a few years with moving again and starting \nFresh I thought things would get better and they did. Besides the constant reminders from my family and my mums friends that I was a horrible child. I changed for the better and by the end of high school I finally had some friends that I could trust almost as if they were my real family.  \nHowever it didn’t last long the apparently alpha of our group was being a total asshole and I called him out on it. I thought everyone would have my back but I was wrong. Everyone just started ignoring me and pretended that I didn’t exist. It didn’t help when the alpha of our group said that I apparently show his mum my dick. \nIf they were really my friends they’d know that I didn’t but they didn’t even ask for my side. \nThis whole kicked out of the group thing happened in 2020 so things were so shitty for the longest time. I hadn’t spoken to anyone in months and i had never felt so alone. Out of no where one of my old friends invites me over for a tiny birthday thing just him and me. \nI was so desperate for a friend that I accepted and bought him a present and went to hang out at his. However when I got there the alpha of the group was there and pretending like he didn’t put me through hell. But the worst thing about the whole thing was that the friend who invited me over didn’t even speak to me the whole time I was there. Just took the present and fucked off.\nI didn’t know what to do. I was so desperate to be around people that I just sat there and accepted it. \nIt was then that I got a text from a girl I knew. She asked me how I was doing and replied with “I’m fine, how are you”? A complete lie of coarse. \nShe told me that she was having the worst time of her life. Her friends made up horrible rumours about her and she drop out of school and became suicidal. \nIt was then that I felt like I finally had a purpose in life. I had to help this girl. Losing everything is one of the worst pains that anyone could ever feel and I just could not let this girl to go through the same thing.\n\nI spent months talking to her, making sure she was ok and encouraged her to talk to other people. We told each other everything and I think I fell in love with her. This wasn’t some childish romance or some high school girlfriend. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. \nHowever she never felt the same way back. \nThen we just stopped talking. At first she would only talk at a certain period of the day, then only talk a few days a week, then nothing. I would always initiate the conversation and she reply with weak answers to my question. I know she’s probably seeing someone else now. I think the worst part is that she made me care about her.\n\nI’m fucking pissed. Everything that surrounds me is shit. I just want to lash out but I’m afraid I might turn out like my dad. I just hate everything and everyone.",

    "selftext": "Every doctor I've come across as of late has either been a complete dipshit, an opportunistic psychopath, or hopelessly pseudoscientific. I can't trust these people anymore and I'm ready to snap at my next appointment. No wonder why people don't trust vaccine companies or the medical staff administering them. I had a stroke when I was 21 because of horrible malpractice by the doctors at my university. They were only worried about people suing them, they didn't give a rat's fuck about any patient in their care. When I was having my stroke and I abruptly lost almost half my vision, these fuckers claimed it was a migrane and sent me home because nothing came up on the CT scan. They could have given me an MRI, but didn't want to spare any effort. I was left with permanent damage and a right field cut because of the actions of these swine. We couldn't sue them because they would just say it was too risky to administer the tpi(or whatever the fuck) and we wouldn't even get that much money back as a result. Back home, my local hospital(one of the best in the country, allegedly) couldn't even figure out the cause of my stroke so they ruled it cryptogenic. Without even performing every test. They just threw up their hands. \n\nAs a side note. I've also been seeing \"alternative medicine\" specialists as part of my mom's idea of treatment plan. She believes she can cure me of my Autism and ADHD by correcting things like diet and special herbs. I've become sort of co-dependent to this idea, but now I'm just disgruntled and enraged. Because all of the doctors on this side of the fence have been quacks who push their own supplements or have weird ass practices like chelation and coffee enemas. Ever since I had the stroke, it's just confirmed her theory that my brain is \"inflamed\" and not neurodivergent. She now thinks that people like me are vulnerable to \"vaccine injuries\" I used to fall for this shit, but now I'm just fed up with things that aren't backed by peer reviewed research. Because I'm so damn co-dependent I'm having trouble moving out of the house, I feel more and more angry and helpless. My brain is rotting and no doctor is helping. I'm 25 years old, but I feel mentally like a teenager. \n\nI just don't like doctors anymore, because it feels like everyone of them has failed me in some way, shape, or form.",

    "title": "I'm a young angry man, who feels suicidal about my extreme anger issues",
    "selftext": "Hello. Im gonna try to be honest about my issues. Im a young man. I come from a foreign background/ my parents are not from America. My father had anger issues growing up, and my mom wasn't really any better. It felt like everyday I was in pre school, I would come home to some crazy fight, and I THE TODDLER would tell my parents not to fight. Fighting continued until my dad cheated on my mom twice and split the family up in 3rd/4th grade. I used to be a little shit to his new girlfriend he moved literally down the street with, because well from what I remember, my mom liked it? And I did too, it kind of made me feel closer to my mom or like I was doing the right thing. All I got from that was my mom turning the hurtful things my dads girlfriend would say to me on me, so I was the loser. These things built up resentment in me. On top of this start, my parents were in a very religious group, and infidelity was a big no no, but my father just used the cliche \"we weren't close anymore or in love\" bs. I took my religion  seriously at the time, so I thought that was bs and cue more resentment. On top of that, from 4th grade to 9th grade, my dad put his GFs son in my school, and he took all my friends. It was like there was a better version of me. So while all of this is happening, my parents are going through divorce proceedings and my mom has to handle a lot on her own, and had a LOT of anger from the way my father treated her. I hadnt been that bad of a kid growing up, but I guess I got worse. By 6th grade she was calling me a devil/rebel. She was the first person to call me the N word. She blamed me for her not finishing college etc. More resentment building up. And... My parent's are foreign, so I was expected to take all this pain and just shove it down and be a good kid and great academic. I refused lol. Anyway, In 7th grade up, I found music, all types, classical, rock, hip hop, and honed my song writing and trumpet skills. I found one peace of solace in this big mess of a life. My parents and their religion rejected my love of music, saying I couldn't be religious and a musician, one of THOSE crazy cults that decides everything about your life. This saddened me. Sometimes, I could just see the anger on my moms face when I would do a required class for band, she wouldnt give me food when I had a concert. All of this is happening, and my father is sick with sarcoidosis, some rare disease. I didnt know if he would live or die, but now I dont care because he started a new family before I even graduated. I started smoking weed to get away from everything, feeling like Id never get my goal of being a musican even tho everyone ouside my hosue said I was the best. I had severe suicidal thoughts and all. So thats the back story. Eventually, I figured out I had been assualted by a female cousin, not as bad as others but the way she did it could have easily killed my 1/2nd grade body. I didnt tell anyone cus I wasn't close to family when I recalled the innicdent. Fast forward to me turning 18 and my aunt dies on my birthday, and her 30yo daughter who assualted me comes to live with us. I guess i buried it deep down, but once she started flirting with my friends, I lost it and we got into a fight. I ended up spending a night in jail, and had to go live with my dad while she stayed in my moms house. This sounds so unrealistic but its true. Okay, so eventually I just couldnt take all this nonsense, and just started acting really going crazy. I would swear a lot and scream, and fight with my mom and family, saying all sorts of terrible things, the worst things you could possibly imagine. And it continued from like 16- now and im like 23. I got kicked out a 2nd time (not like the first when I fought with my cousin) because I was fighting and had insane anger issues. I just had/have nothing. Ive been emotionally manipulated to hate music, the one thing that was there for me cus of a religion that my family didnt follow. I smoke weed but stopped recently, yet that caused me to go to rehab. Got attacked by an aunt. Multiple suicide attempts. I really look at this post, and just feel like fuk my life no one cares and no ones gonna help me, and Ive tried therapy and nothing really helped besides one, and Ill never see her again because I moved states. When I look back, i might as well do it, every time I lash out at my family I feel bad and want to kill myself. Im a terrible son, who basically is worthless. I made two albums this year but feel like they will never take off. So i have nothing to live for. Im a disgrace. Does it make sense I have these issues? Is there hope? My family doesn't deserve this crazy anymore im basically an abuser and i just wanted to be a positive musician. Sign. I remember being a kid wanting to be positive and my life is a mess while everyone just moves on. I have no friends cus of my many moves, and no love cus Idk maybe I should actually just do this... any positivity would be nice I guess haha",

When i learnt that anger can actually be caused by damage to the brain which leaves people unable to control their impulses, i started to understand anger a bit more. I am still scared of angry people but this really gave me empathy for angry people because i learnt that it can actually be a processing pathway in the brain that causes you to not be able to control your angry impulses. I used to think it was just illogical to be angry and i'm sorry if you have come across anyone who thinks that way! Truely didn't understand. I am not a very angry person most of the time people ask me why i'm not angry, i just say well i weighed it up and whats the point. But i have my fair share of problems don't you worry about that! Just anger isn't one of them. It's puts me at a bit of a disadvantage cause i'm not too sensitive to what makes people angry, cause it wouldn't make me angry?  \n\n\nI just wanted to share because if you are struggling with Anger, maybe give yourself a bit of a break.

My gpa was in the shitter and I just didn't like being away from home for so long, even though I was only an hour away. But I didn't have a car so I couldn't just go home when I wanted to. Well add on top of this, my roommate gets busted drinking in our room and I have to pay a $150 fine, otherwise I could get in even more trouble. And at the time I'm washing dishes in the dining hall making $8.50 an hour and having spent almost $400 on textbooks. But that's not the end.\n\nI get a call that one of my few friends from home was in an accident and was knocked off his motorcycle. So I'm freaking out and freaking out all week. But then I get another call.....he died. Not from his injuries, but from the anesthesia they gave him. He had an allergic reaction and slipped into a coma. A few days later, his family finally gave the consent and they unplugged him. This is when my fury and heartbreak really comes out...\n\nAfter I got off the phone with my dad and he told me what happened, I let out the loudest and longest \"fuck\" I have ever said, tossing my phone right into the door to my dorm. I completely trash my kitchen since that's where I was when I took the call and broke the window by launching the coffee table at it, punched a hole in the cupboard door, nearly ripped off a cabinet door, and threw our chairs right at the entrance door, smashing them to pieces. My place was completely turned upside down. It finally ended when I was just screaming \"fuck\" over and over and over again as loud as I could, slamming my fists into the counter-top until I finally passed out. I woke up in the hospital with all my knuckles broken on both hands and a bandage wrapped around my head since I fell on hardwood. And my throat hurt so bad I couldn't even talk.

You see, my father is a self-made millionaire and unfortunately, this has resulted in him being egotistical and feeling that he is superior to everyone and that no one can beat him. \n\nThe story started when him, my mother and I, were having breakfast at a McDonald’s. My mother was talking about how she was considering to enrol my youngest sister to a swimming class because she has done that for me when I was younger. This made me curious as to how my mother found my swimming instructor (as my family and I used to live in a private condominium where swimming instructors were very hard to come by) so I asked her that question. Keep in mind that at this point, I was just having a nice normal conversation with my mother without even involving my father. Just then, my father interrupted us and told us how my conversation was “stupid”. He claimed that it was so because he thought that I should know where I was taught for my swimming lessons (which was at my family’s old private condominium) when in fact I was asking an entirely different question to my mother of how did she find my instructor. He also claimed that my mother should not have been agitated when replying me when in fact she was not at all. I then tried to correct him but he kept insisting that he was right (even though he jumped in conclusion). At this point, I was still kind of light heartedly talking to him while trying to correct him at the same time. Suddenly, he told me to stop being a stupid bitch (or something like that, I can’t entirely remember). This made me frustrated so my tone became even more aggressive while trying to explain to him that he was wrong. After a while, he told me to save my breath. He then claimed that I was disrespecting him because I was old enough to think already and that I was “shaming” him in public. When we got back to the car, he threatened to cut all financial expense towards me. When we got back home, he told me to pass my glasses to him which I stupidly did because I didn’t know what he was going to do next. He took my brand new glasses that I have just gotten 2 days ago and smashed it on the floor. He then forced me to apologise to me. After that he asked me to pass my glasses to him again which I stupidly did again because I thought he felt bad and wanted to repair for me. But nope, he made it even worse by taking my glasses and snapping it into half. He then ignored me after that and left for work. \n\nWhat’s wrong with him?

The SF Bay Area is an unforgiving hellscape for the working class.  Her parents are toxic people with a toxic relationship, and spend their days shouting, fighting, and sniping at each other any time they’re in the same room.\n\nMoving on, last night my wife and our daughter were over at wife’s coworkers’ house watching football.  Wife was having a few drinks, our daughter was running around playing with the other kids there.  Our daughter and her needed to get back home, so I drove the two of them back in her mother’s car, since she borrowed it because she’s currently carless (again, another post for another time.)\n\nWe get to the house and we go upstairs to put our daughter to bed.  The MiL comes out of her room raising hell because I’m there.  She starts one of her trademark tirades and I let her get her hooks in.  Told her to go to hell, and when she continued running her mouth I yelled “fuck you” to her and she slammed the door to her room.\n\nI wish I was satisfied with that.  I’m not.  I want to take my hand to her face and a bat to her car.  I won’t, for obvious reasons.  But I can feel the anger smoldering and burning me from the inside out until all that’s left is a burned out husk and some scattered ashes.  I keep mentally replaying last night’s events over and over, getting myself angrier and angrier and I can’t stop it.  Maybe I don’t want to.

    "selftext": "I had a job and a house. No friends, no girlfriend/wife. I was 36. I have extreme social anxiety, I may tell you why later but now it's about the topic.\n\nI lost my job. I couldn't pay my house without a job but at the same time my parents (at the time both 65) were looking for a place to live so I let them live in my house and they paid it until I could get a job.\n\nIt's been 2 years and I've gotten no job. During those 2 years, my mother, who is an easily offended Catholic fanatic has started multiple yelling tantrums. This is normal for her, she has been doing it since I was a kid and hasn't stopped and will not stop. According to my dad, she hasn't been the same since she lost her first son who died a day after being born. I think it has made her crazy, even though the crazy runs in her family (myself included).\n\nThis time, two or three days ago (I can't tell because I've slept on sleeping pills and benadryl and haven't kept the time) I woke up early to her screaming at my older brother (on the phone) who actually has a job and a wife (My mom hates her for many reasons). This is no normal screaming, this is crazy-ass hate-filled screeching from hell. My dad tried to calm her down but then she got just as mad at him. (She also got into a fight with her sister, because when my mom gets angry, she has to get angry with everybody)\n\nI stayed quiet and didn't get into it because I knew nothing good could have come of it. The day passed and the next day my mom decided to again call my brother and start screaming at him. So after that screaming match I lost it (I inherited it from her) and also started screaming and I broke one of her Virgin Mary statues and cursed and I don't remember well. I also got into my car and went to my brother's house, not knowing what I was going to do there.\n\nI got there and I said something about losing the only family I have thanks to him (my mom and dad are old and have high blood pressure) and started crying like a bitch and could barely breathe like the piece of shit that I am. My brother tried to calm me but once I calmed down, I just left.\n\nJust before I went to my brother's house, I sent him a message on Facebook about how he's an asshole and how his wife is a fat slut that was responsible for her previous husband's suicide and a bunch of other things that now guarantee I will never be in good terms with any of them. By the way, his wife read them somehow. I haven't used facebook in years so I don't know if the message was public or if my brother showed it to her.\n\nSo I get home and decide to just sleep it off, so I take 2mg of Clonazepam (legally obtained from my psychiatrist) and took two little cups of benadryl so I could just fall asleep and not do anything stupid anymore.\n\nBut while I was sleeping I hear my mom cursing and screaming in her usual banshee way and I get up and confront her. (note: My dad wasn't there and she wasn't talking on the phone. She was literally screaming at nothing). I don't know exactly what happened but I got so mad that I just started wailing on her and also took another of her statues and bashed it against my own head (but nothing happened I think) then I got into my car and I don't remember much except a security guard told me that I had to turn off my lights (I was sleeping in the car). I don't really remember what happened because I was sleepy but eventually I got home and slept until now.\n\nI slept good, it was all a bad dream until I woke up and realized it really happened.\n\nBy the way, this is the second time I hit my mom, so sleepiness is no excuse. The other time I think I didn't hit her too hard but it was bad. Even after that I was still her favorite son for some reason. Maybe it's because I pretend to be religious just to make her \"happy\". I go to church with her and sometimes pray with her but I don't really believe in any of it and just do it because I can see how she's saddened that my other two brothers are not religious people. I won't keep up the act anymore because obviously it doesn't make her any happy. This is why I broke her Virgin statue. She likes dissing people who don't believe and she's a super Catholic but she still loves getting into crazy-screaming arguments (these are not normal arguments, I'm talking about red-faced screeching vitrol and hate and not stopping or reconciling in weeks if not months.. she did that to me when I was a kid. I would misbehave and she would scream and hit me and when I cried she told me to stop making a scene because she \"wasn't hitting me hard enough\" which might have been true, but I (we, because she did it to all of us) was crying less at the \"pain\" and more at the hate that came out of what was normally a loving mother.\n\nI have extreme social anxiety. I don't talk to people because I am afraid of offending them or because I think I'm a piece of shit and they will (and have) reject me. I blame my upbringing for it. My mother also gets extremely easily offended over everything. She wants to live in a world of pure Catholic cleanliness. Luckily my social anxiety keeps me from having a wife and family so I won't be beating them anytime soon. Maybe I deserve it.\n\nTLDR: I'm a worthless piece of shit I just beat up my elderly mother.\n\nI want to sell my home and move alone. I don't know what to do with the rest of my family. Should I be alone?\n",

    "selftext": "This is gonna be quite a story so errr... if you want to skip to the TL:DR just scroll to the bottom.\n\nAlright, I wont try to come off as the victim here, although I feel like I am the only victim in this family.\n\nEver since I was a child, I've lived in a torn apart family where my father believes in old school crap discipline where you should beat up your child, the child must do sports etc. \n\nMy mother on the other hand has been a ... how should I say this, she's mentally ill, and clinically diagnosed with it too that is. She suffers from anorexia, major depressive disorder, hypochondria, anxiety and a ton of other mental disorders that I don't know about (yet). My father left my mother when I was at the age of 4, this was because my mother was leaving a huge negative imprint on my mind at my young age, she was filling me with religious crap that made me dismiss any rational things about the world, my dad realized this was harmful so he tried to \"save\" me by literally kidnapping me and taking me to Denmark. There he found this fat lady whom he married, he and this fat lady both abused me and made a lot of fun of me, they called me worthless, dumb, you fucking name it, they literally didnt allow me to speak when we had guests, and my father would often torment me because I was afraid of the dark, he'd toss me out of the house in the middle of the night when it was pitch dark outside, and I was like 8 at the time. He'd lock me up in the bathroom and pulled the plug to the electricity so I couldn't see crap and held me locked up there, He would beat me up if I scored badly in school, and worst of all, he didnt let me meet my mother, nor keep in touch with her.\n\nI was just a child, so obviously I would start to worry about her, despite his attempts of telling me that she's sick and unable to help me, I couldn't find his words trustworthy mainly because he bullied me.\n\nSo when I was doing school, I would often sneak away from school to my mother's place, took a 30 minute long train ride to her place and yeah, I loved her and all that, she loves me too, but at an early age, I believe... at the age of 11? I learned that there's something \"off\" about her.\n\nAll she did was isolate herself, scream at people, act all paranoid about people talking crap about her, she would constantly brag, but worst of all, she kept talking about death. HER OWN death that is, she kept talking about suicide, how satan is gonna tear her soul out in her sleep and kill her, how her heart is gonna fail. Each time she got a little sick, say she got a flu or common cold, she would panic about being dying sick, and of course this made me extremly scared, since I was a child, so I called the hospital at times and unfortunately it resulted in my mother being locked up in a mental hospital for a month or two, after which my entire family started hating me. \n\nI had no idea it was my fault she had been locked up, hell, I didn't know jack shit about her diseases or disorders, time passed, she returned, and my dad's beatings got worse, my grades became terrible, I used to bully a muslim kid at school, I was 13 at the time I bullied him, and I felt so guilty at the time.\n\nEventually I apologized to him, had an emotional breakdown of guilt and he forgave me, we became good friends and I got to escape my home every now and then by going to his place. Time passed, he moved and I lost contact with him, so I had to go home again, then I realized my father had abused my sister to the point where she literally left and never came back, she went to another city to live with one of her relatives. I tried doing the same but nothing worked, and after one night when my dad kneed me in the face because I had forgotten to take the dog out for a walk, I had enough of that shit.\n\nI reported him to the police and child services and I was taken from my dad and given to my mom, at this time I was happy that I was reunited with my mom. I 15 I believe.\n\nLittle did I know, my fucking mother was even worse than before. She had become physically abusive, and worst of all, she had turned my sister into something like herself, they were both the same, their beliefs the same, their reactions the same, although my sister was older than me and wiser, she too knew mom was sick, but ... somehow lived in peace with her, by being the same as her.\n\nThey would both become hysterical and shit when anything happened, and they would often call me a broken child, psychopath kid or sociopath because I felt emotionally distant from them. I isolated myself a lot in my room, to study and read my stuff, my grades kept fluctuating, I'm really good at maths and other scientific subjects, yet my entire family thinks of me as dumb because I often got bad grades :/\n\nSo yeah, I felt left out, things kept getting worse, my mother started assaulting me, beating herself up and blaming me, she literally once banged her face into the wall and said she'd tell the police I've abused her. so I fled my home for another week, I just stayed on the streets till the police picked me up and forced me to go home.\n\nTime passed, I became 19. I tried to move out of the house to find a home of my own, I work and study at university, I'm studying theoretical physics. My request to take a loan was declined for err.. many reasons, so I had no choice but to stay at my mother's place for another 1 - 3 years. \n\nI've started to realize a lot of what my father has said about her when I was a child, and each time I bring it up to her that she's ill and I cant communicate well with her, I try to stay calm, I say it in a kind and loving tone, I've tried hugging her, speaking nicely, you name it.\n\nThere's absolutely NOTHING I can do, sometimes she just, SNAPS into this HYSTERICAL mode where she goes like \"ITS YOUR FAULT IM SICK YOU TRAITOR\" , \"IF I DIE ITS YOUR FAULT\", \"ILL KILL MYSELF BECAUSE OF YOU\", and my sister just assaults me, EVEN AT this age.\n\nToday morning, when I was going out to buy my mother's medicine, my mother stopped me.\n\nShe told me I'm not allowed to pay using credit card, I asked her why and she said the pharmacy will trick me and charge me with extra money, she's this weird conspiracy theorist.\n\nI told her it's fine, she refuses to let me leave. So I gently try to pry my way past her, suddenly she grabs me by the hair and yanks it. I twist her arm and tell her to let go or ill defend myself, she pushes me back, and my sister goes \"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN MOM\", and attacks me\n\nAt this point I just... lost it, I started punching her and my mother in their faces so many times till they were bloody, and I just left the house. They didnt get knocked out nor did I cause any serious injury, they just got bloodied up like.. swollen lips and bleeding noses. EVEN THEN they tried to attack me, my mother grabbed a knife from the kitchen but I quickly left, and fortunately I had most of it recorded on my phone, all I did was to fucking defend myself.\n\n\nRight now I'm at a friend's place, and my hands are still shaking, I honestly dont know what the fuck to do about them, this is the first time I've striked back, not once have I defended myself the way I did today.\n\nI've got extremly low self-esteem, my father and mother have filled me with crap like \"you're ugly\" \"worthless\" \"dumb\" \"stupid\" \"mistake\" \n\nI've been to many psychologists and they often recommended I leave home, but when I tell them I can't due to financial issues they just shrug it off.\n\nI'm on the edge of just, ugh, I don't know, I'm just scared, sad and angry. My sister who've left home is supporting me, she knows how it feels, shes the only one who've been through the same crap, all other family members are against me. I don't know what to do or who's at fault here...\n\nSorry for taking your time with this drama crap, I just felt like I need to be heard, and no I'm not gonna kill or beat up anyone, or harm, it's not in my nature, I hate violence. I'm a pacifist at heart.\n\nTLDR: \nMother and father abused me since I was a kid, I finally snapped and beat my mother and sister up in return. \n\nSorry :/\n\n",

My kid pushed my buttons so bad, that I punched a hole in the door.

I asked if she had time to talk this week and she said yes, but her voice sounded so cold that I am left in the dark whether it's going to be a divorce announcement or a talk to work things out.\n\nWe've been together for 12+ years and married for 7. During our marriage we both struggled with putting our kid to bed, it's nearly always a moment we're both triggered.

    "selftext": "I am a newly wed in my mid-thirties and have been with my wife for 7 years. The older I get, the more I realize I have some toxic personality traits I need to change. Just typing that is hard to do because I don't think of myself as a toxic person, but I guess that's classic denial, right? I think of myself as a mostly level-headed person who is loving and supportive but if I stop and really examine who I am, I see that isn't the full picture. I have a problem with my ego. I mistakenly view myself as the \"man of the house\" or \"head of the household\", which I know is wrong, patriarchal and outdated. This is probably because I grew up during a time where this was more common and saw it during my own upbringing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can often be argumentative, confrontational and like to be right all the time. Being in an argument with me can feel like being interrogated because I argue indefatigably. I am quick to anger over trivial issues and just as quick to (mis)place blame. I say condescending and hurtful things which I apologize for later but the apologies ring more hollow as time goes on because my behavior doesn't change. My wife is smart, patient, forgiving and rarely gets angry. She takes good care of herself mentally and physically and has much better control over her emotions than I do. I'm not all bad, but this post isn't for me to defend myself. It is to acknowledge that despite the things I do right, I am doing many other things wrong, and they are unfair to the person I love the most. So I'm asking for your insight. Have you or a significant other overcome this kind of behavior? How? Transcendental meditation? Therapy? Medication? Exercise? A self-help book? I am open to all suggestions and perspectives. I know there aren't any quick fixes or shortcuts here.",

I followed them, wanting to find their house before I came to my senses & realized that wasn’t a good idea. \n\nIt’s those thoughts. I read the news & watch the yootoob videos about the terrible things people have done to others, deservedly or not & wonder to myself; ‘Amateurs! Lecter; Now there’s an inspiration! I wonder what he’d do. Always kind to the underdog, always vicious to an abuser or a rude person.

He's always had a bit of a temper, but has so far (thankfully) never hurt anyone, but lately he's just been so volatile, it feels like you're walking on eggshells around him.\n\nIt sort of reached a new peak yesterday and today though; yesterday, he was told that he was not getting an award from the school after he (and a few others) were mistakenly put on the award list - he's never gotten an award before so it was a big deal to him, so when he found out that it was a mistake, he went off to his friends and his girlfriend about it and became angrily, verbally abusive when they tried to tell him to calm down. Cut to today, his girlfriend sends him a text and breaks up with him because, understandably, she's scared of him.\n\nAnd now he's in this state of mind where he wants to change schools because he's convinced that all his friends hate him now, he's blocked all his friends on social media, he's just in a really awful place, probably the worst I've seen him in mentally.\n\nHe does this thing where he gets into this awful feedback loop where he gets angrier and angrier at himself, because he can't control his anger very well. He's currently on medication (antidepressants, I think) and he sees a therapist (though, the medical infrastructure for mental health in this town is really whack, and his next appointment is literally next year) and I'm just really worried about him. So far, his anger is only manifesting in yelling (which is still not acceptable) and borderline self-harm, pounding on his head and chest and stuff. I just get this unavoidable feeling that one day he is going to hurt someone or hurt himself.\n\nI am god-awful at consoling people or talking about feelings and stuff, but I just feel like I should be helping him in some way, but I'm worried that I'll say or do something that will set him off worse.\n\nFor extra context, I am the oldest sibling in the family out of six, the brother in question is number 4. I am the only one who has so far left home, so naturally I interact with him the least out of the family, but I think he looks up to me and I don't know, I feel like I should do something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo any of you have any advice on what I can do to help, or if this is something that I should maybe stay away from or what, I have no idea what to do.",

Slowly but surely, with the help of a professional and with the words of advice and wisdom from experience I found in this channel, I feel like having anger issues is not an entire death sentence.\n\nOften times we minimize the hurt we feel or we are demonized for the hurt we instill. Neither of these responses to anger have ever helped anyone move forward and grow. So I am grateful that instead I found a community in which talking about the worst of it is not only allowed but stimulated without judgement and it has shown me over and over that there is hope for us if we are willing to learn to accept and embrace ourselves and learn to let go whatever triggers us because we deserve to be happy too.\n\nWhatever your current situation may, wherever you are on your path, be it by yourself or with someone at your side, you are never truly alone however lonely you may feel in the moments of distress. I am glad to have joined reddit and most notably, this subreddit.\n\nI hope you too find peace in yourself, even if it's just a little bit, it's worth it to appreciate and to nurture it.

I never wanted to accept my own anger. I learned to dissociate from pain as a way of coping with life. It was my way of not letting it all get to me. But it made me cold, numb, inaccessible and invisible to everyone, including myself. It meant that feelings would stew and build, not be expressed or resolved. It made me seem reserved, thoughtful and oddly mature to some people, but that was always superficial.\n\nMy needs didn’t matter - I was living in someone else’s storm. It’s like I took my soul and buried it in a time capsule for safe keeping, knowing I would get it back eventually. I just needed to weather the storm until then. That’s my superpower - stubbornness. Passive aggression. Avoidance. Denial.\n\nBut it made boundaries difficult to both define and enforce. They were either too weak or too strong. Either I would let others push me around, or I would overstep them too easily and feel guilty, or I would just put the walls up altogether.\n\nI’m only just coming to terms with my anger - I was always afraid of it, in a way. Afraid of rocking the boat, lest someone spot me and make something out of me. Trust and anxiety issues would remain, while I pretended that they didn’t affect me. But of course they did. And they stuck hard. \n\nAnd I blamed other people for this. My own inability to let go. I’m now realising that’s my responsibility. I’m too stubborn - I’m the only one who can defuse me. I understand that now. That’s it’s on me to defuse my anger and let it go. To forgive myself for not being able to withstand the pain I experienced. \n\nTo accept that I was victimised.

Let me reiterate: I have a lot of completely acceptable reasons to have pent up anger inside. Shitty childhood, abusive people in my life, friends abandoning me, blablabla. But, I've made choices to get over that stuff and would like to think I've done a pretty damn good job growing up into a (fairly) normal person with a nice sense of humor who likes to make people laugh.\n\nBut I'm always angry. Not *actively* angry, but, at any moment, something minuscule can bring me to 100% absolute blinding rage.  \n\nMy current example: I have 7 pet snakes. 2 adults and 5 babies. I asked my fiancé to buy snake foods (we feed them frozen mice, it's easier) and I (mistakenly) told him that we already had frozen adult mice for the bigguns, so he'd only need to buy 3 baby frozen mice (we had 2 already).\n\nTurns out we had *only* frozen baby mice, and *no* adult frozen mice so now I have more babies than I need and no adults to feed my bigguns. \n\nAll in all, this is a small problem. We can feed the other two tomorrow. No big deal. It's a little annoying to be feeding animals on different days, especially if you have a lot of them, but we can get back on track very easily.\n\nBut right now, I want to punch things. Bite myself. Scream, yell at people and hurt them with the things I say. I want to FUCKING RAGE all over everything. And it's because, I can't feed them all at the same time. Or it might be because I thought things were one way, but they're actually another way, and it's fucked up the plan I made in my head when I thought things were the other way. \n\nI have no outlet for this. I do not know what to do. I can't deal with it because I get so, so mad at the smallest things, and it's all I can do to just sit there and cry silently or try to just bite my arm and dissipate the red I see so that I can function normally and not scare everyone in my life away. \n\nI don't really have a lot of time to describe this anger, since I'm making dinner and defrosting things to feed to snakes. I can only describe it as a feeling that manifests instantly and will. not. go. away. unless I hurt myself (biting, slamming my fists on things, hitting myself in the head, slapping myself in the face) throwing shit, breaking shit, screaming, OR, better yet, saying awful words that would very much offend someone if they were on the receiving end of them.\n\nIf I don't throw a tantrum and act like a fucking moron, it just sits there, sucking up all my thoughts and energy, and leaving me drained and depressed afterward. It's literally painful, for me to get angry, and not because I hurt myself to make it go away. I'm saying when I get mad, I feel a type of pain. It's exhausting. I hate it. I hate it I hate it I hate it. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm getting married, I want kids. I want a normal life. I want to be kind and welcoming, not angry and hateful. \n\nWhy am I so angry? When I saw the Avengers and the Hulk said, \"That's my secret: I'm always angry.\"\n\nIt's cheesy but I fucking relate to that. I feel like the hulk. It's like a fucking nerve and it gets hit and I fucking go off and feel like it's out of my control. But that's the thing.. it is! It is of course in my control. Somewhere, deep down inside, I'm making a choice to be this way. BUT HOW?! AND WHY?! What the fuck do I do?\n\nTl;Dr: I feel like the hulk in the sense that I feel my anger is like a nerve that, when hit, blows up and turns into this huge ball of painful hatred that I can't get rid of without causing harm to myself or to objects or to others. Emotional harm. I'm not violent towards others. Only myself. If I don't do something to \"expel\" the emotion, it sits and weighs me down, eventually literally exhausting me to the point where I have to lay down.

For instance, one time we were getting ready at mine to head to a club, we were swapping clothes and she would body shame me and say things like 'isn't it interesting how different clothes look different on each others bodies? My stomach looks so flat and it looks so different on you'. When we got to the club she ditched me to go home with some guy and left me on my own and didn't follow up for two days to check if I was ok. I was the one who reached out first, we had a general chat but she was cold with me. \n(Now, a couple months before this my ex and I had broken up. He had cheated on me, he was also in this friend group so we had kept things civil but I was still annoyed with him).\nSo she brought up the fact that I was not happy with my ex, that I needed to forgive him and move on and that I was being cruel by not doing so. She had never been angry on my behalf of what he did, never stuck up for me or held him accountable and was now saying I was the one in the wrong. I wasn't really angry at the time, just disappointed in her. I ended up blocking her on everything. \n\nBut over the years I have heard about what she's doing and seen photos of her through mutuals and it makes my blood boil. She seems to lead this perfect life, she just got engaged, has a great job and when I hear something about her I'm angry for weeks. \n\nI think it happens when I'm failing in my own life. I'm stuck in a dead-end job, struggling financially and my relationship is rocky. It's her voice in my head telling me I'm not good enough.\nHas this happened to anyone? How do I move on? \n\nThanks in advance. ",

    "title": "I just want to fight people all the time. How can I calm down?",
    "selftext": "I’m a combat veteran and have ptsd as a result. I’ve handled it pretty well so far and only used to get triggered by 2 or 3 very specific things, but recently I’ve started becoming really overprotective of people I care about. I don’t have any blood family left, and in combat your squad is your family and you would do anything to protect them and have their back. I seem to have carried over this feeling to the team I now work with in a regular office job. I made a Reddit post previously about how I’ve been having trouble sleeping after my ptsd was triggered recently, and I have occasionally fallen asleep at work but my colleagues and my boss have let me sleep because they could see I desperately needed it. I think I can fall asleep around them because i subconsciously have that feeling of safety when I’m around them. We are a close team and hang out outside of work too. But now I’m really struggling to control my anger when someone disrespects them, does something to them they don’t like etc. One time someone from another team tried to blame my colleague for something they didn’t do, and I found myself standing up and going in between them so he would stop shouting at him. I tried to tell him to back off as calmly as I could but other colleagues ended up getting between us and making the other guy leave to go back to his office. It took me a long time to calm down and I really just wanted to go in there and threaten him. I know that’s bad and something I’d probably get fired for so I took the rest of the day off. My boss was really understanding when I explained why I was feeling that way and why I reacted that way. He knows I’m struggling at the moment and he believe that I will get back on my feet and I really appreciate his belief in me as it makes me think that I can get past this. \n\nI’m starting to worry about myself though, as the most recent incident could’ve been a lot worse. We were at a bar after work, and some drunk idiot started on my friend, knocked the beer out of his hand and pushed him a few times, and I just saw red. I dragged him straight outside but the guys friends pulled him away and into another bar, and my friends kept trying to stop me from going after him. The guy didn’t even hurt my friend, just pushed him, I don’t know why I reacted so badly, but my first instinct was to react. In fight or flight I am 100% fight. I was desperate to go after him but I didn’t want to end up accidentally physically hurting my friends who were trying to pull me back. We went back inside the bar for another beer but the whole time I was staring at the door waiting for him to come back in here. If my friends hadn’t pretty much forced me to go home at the same time as them, I would’ve gone to find him. How can I stop this? I feel aggressive and it’s kinda exhausting. I just want to fight to get it out but I know that is not a good way. ",

This means that he overthinks things and can get super upset easily if we fight or something goes wrong. \n\nHe has punched himself many times to the point where his face is swollen and unrecognisable. He has smashed his phone 3 times in the past 2 months. He punches walls, slams doors and yells. Just general getting out of control.\n\nTonight it got really out of hand. It was 11;30pm and we had an argument outside in a car park.  then he sped off in his car and called me. He was screaming down the phone at me and honestly I though he had crashed it sounded like he was going so fast. He came back home but I had called his mum as I thought he had an accident and when he found this out he lost it. it got heated, he pushed me out the way as I was trying to take his car keys off him and then he smashed a pub window, cutting his hands. It was really bad and two people came over to us and tried to call an ambulance but in the end he calmed down enough to go to his parents for a first aid kit. After punching the glass he was crying and saying how I am definitely going to break up with him now. We are ok now, back from his parents and in bed.\n\nHe has never hit me and I know he would never  but sometimes I get in the way as tonight and he pushes or throws things and it’s only a matter of time before someone else aside him gets hurt accidentally. It upsets me that he has no care for objects or our flat (ie the walls, smashing things)\n\nI love him but I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. He has been going to counselling, though this has not helped. I think he needs specific anger management counselling and I’ve said that, though it’s never materialised. \n\nAny advice on how to deal with this anger or success stories?\n\nEdit: I love him so so much and want to stay life long friends regardless of what happens in our relationship. Saying that if he didn’t have these issues I would not question if want to stay with him romantically as much.\n\nEdit 2: also sometimes I react angrily (not physical just yelling and saying things I know will hurt him) when we fight and call him attention seeking or a psycho. Not tonight, but I have in the past and then felt truly awful as I know he has underlying issues.",

A little bit of background, I was raised in a very restrictive religion and experienced sexual and mental abuse from both of my parents. Pair that with a traumatic and very abusive 6 year marriage and more sexual assault over the years and its the perfect recipe for some serious PTSD and anger issues. My boyfriends parents used to yell at him a lot as a kid, so for him its very triggering when I yell at him. For me, I took that form of abuse and unfortunately made it my own. When I get angry about stuff it feels like I'm going from 0 to 100. He's told me many times that he can't handle it when I yell and I'm scared that one day I'm going to loose him.

Its like i don't know how else to communicate intense emotions other than through anger.. when I'm sad I get angry. When I'm depressed I get angry. I feel like I'm scared to experiencing any other emotion. Or maybe like I don't deserve to be happy. Then after a blow out my boyfriend treats me.like nothing happened and tries to comfort me and i don't let him because i don't feel like i deserve it.. which makes him feel bad. I'm at a loss here... Anyone have any advice on stopping anger before it starts? Also any advice on forgiving yourself after a blow out?",

In their opinion, I'm always fat I'm always ugly and I'm always stupid and lazy in their eyes. And maybe I am, but a shitty person I'm not. I fail my exams sure, but I'm no criminal no drug user etc. i'm not an athlete but i'm fit enough I play sports and stuff. i'm lazy but I try to do things. Yet because of them I look at the mirror and I see a failure. And today at lunch they were going ham at me for being a failure and a disappointment and how I'm destroying myself and throwing my life away and how nobody would hire me to do anything right now I don't even have my driving license. And then they laughed at me.\n\nI couldn't stand all of this and i broke and I don't remember what I said but I threw objects at the window and broke glasses and stuff on the floor but only because I couldn't throw it at them or myself because the consequences would've been too great otherwise. Otherwise I gladly would've.\n\nIt felt too good.\n\nIt's the first time in my life I act like this I'm normally quite the average person. This was the culmination of 10 years of bullying from my own father and mother. The thing is that I recognize that in other fields they are good parents. It's just with me and my studies and my hobbies and my physical aspect that I just can't win.\n\nThus the self prophecy realized itself. You won't believe me, but I used to be reallllygood at school. I used to be reaaaally muscular. I used to have a ton of good hobbies like volounteering, learning languages and olaying an instrument.\n\nNow I flunk my exams very often in uni, i only play videogames and watch movies and I'm not fat at all but nor I am muscular anymore, i have fat on my belly but you wouldn't say i'm fat. So I'm a failure. But it's as much their fault as it is mine. Never once have I heard the words good job from them.\n\nThe only people who ever complimented me have always been my friends. They're my family. But they're getting away the more time passes because life calls\n\n\nI don't feel motivated to do anything but escape my life through distractions",

THEY THEN GET ANGRY AT ME FOR BEING IN THIS STATE\n\nTL,DR: My parents force me to rely on them and then treat me like sh*t for relying on them.\n\nI have been battling depression depersonalisation, hopelessness, anxiety, and feelings of low self worth my entire life. I remember that it got so bad in my teens that I just completely 'bottled up' and lost who I was, basically dropped out of school, and continued my warpath of hatred and feeling like cr*p EVERYDAY, mostly because if you spend this long in one state, you begin to accept it as normal.\n\nI legitimately thought that feeling like cr*ap was a part of growing up and normal.\n\nI've been struggling with staying in jobs my whole adult life, the longest job I've held down was for 6 months, every relationship I've had with a girl ive had has been toxic.\n\nI'm 30 and because of the industry I work in, (cruise ships), I've had to move back in with the parents due to COVID.\n\nUpon returning home, I snapped. COMPLETELY snapped.\n\nIt was then and only then did I start addressing why I am the way I am and I know it's weak to blame other people for things, but I know the reason.\n\nMy parents.\n\nIf I do ANYTHING wrong, be it the slightest thing ie; I  didn't change the coffee filter this morning or I made a noise that woke my dad up, then all hell breaks loose upon me. I'm not exaggerating, all hell breaks loose.\n\nI am never at comfort because of this.\n\nI remember the breaking point in my teens was this and I adopted the persona of, 'i can't live kind this anymore, so I don't give a f*ck, I'll do what I want'.\n\nNow that Im starting to address this, things are becoming clearer and I don't deserve to feel this way.\n\nI'll give you an example of recent events......\n\nSince I've been back at home I've talked to my parents about everything, often they don't listen and the only way to get my message across is by screaming at them and getting angry, then they start to listen, otherwise I am taken for granted and treated life the 'meg (Family Guy)' of the family, but I've had enough.\n\nSo now as my parents are staying to come out of their ego driven power abusing bubbles, to which they apparently have no knowledge about, they are starting to ease up and I am feeling so much better and like my true self again.\n\nBut this doesn't sit with them. They are to egotistical to admit their wrongdoings and can't change, they won't change.\n\nTherefore they try and find and exploit ANY weakness/wrongdoings I have/have done and when they find them, that's it until I break again.\n\nThere whole existence revolves around this.\n\nI'll give you an example; I was feeling the best I had felt in years last night, as I felt my parents were finally getting them messege and easing up on me, after months of screaming to get my way across - I know this sounds childish, but it's the only way they would listen. I felt things were finally 'falling into place'.\n\nWe had a meal and watched a movie, life felt normal again, I felt relaxed and I could feel happiness starting to surge through me again, something that honestly, I haven't felt in over a decade.\n\nOnce the movie finishes, my mum goes into the kitchen to make a drink.\n\n2 minutes later the door bursts wife open and there she is standing there staring at me.\n\nShe proceeds to yell in my face, like literally into my face that I had not taken my vitamins and that with the virus at large, I am being selfish and putting the whole family at risk. I had not taken my morning does, which she is insistent that I do, because we all know Zinc and cod liver oil is the COVID vaccine.\n\nAfter she has finished screaming, she goes to bed.\n\nNow comes my dad.\n\nMy dad knows my ticks, he knows how to get under my skin and like my mum, will strike at any given opportunity.\n\nSo he proceeds to invade my personal space, constantly walk in and out of the room whilst I try to relax, burp and fart as he walks past me. Embarrasses me on the family WhatsApp group, stomps his feet as hard as he can as he walks by me to try and intimidate me, coughs in my general direction, asks me really personal questions,  everything he can to try and make me feel uncomfortable.\n\nMy mum upstairs in her room (directly above the sitting room) stomps her feet as load as she can and keeps moving around to make me feel uncomfortable until she gives up.\n\nThis is a standard evening when they deem something has gone wrong.\n\nAs a result, I close up. I put a wall around me so they can't hurt me emotionally and we're back to square one\n\nHere comes the worst part.......... gaslighting.\n\nThe next day, with both parents in a good mood, they come down on me like a tonne of bricks because I seen sad/angry/depressed. This over the years of them dismissing my feelings has been labeled as me being ungrateful for everything, bitter and disillusioned.\n\nMy mum, now pretending to be a sweet angel, says things like, \"are you ok? \"You seem depressed, you should see a counselor/psychiatrist, you've been depressed for years, you should go on antidepressants\".\n\nMe not addressing the real issue before (them) has led me to spend thousands of pounds on psychiatrist and antidepressants and, and I'm being completely honest here, they have all discharged me saying that yes you have depression, but there is nothing else wrong with you. Despite telling my.parents this, they always want me to go back and spend my money.\n\nThey also have a go at me for not pursuing employment, when I clearly don't have the emotional strength to hold down a job because of them!\n\nI feel so sh*t because I close up and have no emotional release so get messed up, I harbour everything because all I feel is anger towards them for the way they act, but any sign of anger and I'm immediately labeled as disrespectful and ungrateful.\n\nIt's like they have me in a trap: treat him like dirt, make him feel crazy for being angry/sad, make him apologise or flip out/treat him like dirt for flipping out or make him feel like it's all in his head for being sad/depressed and the cycle continues to feed their power trip.\n\nEverything I've told you here I've explained to them, many times.\n\nAnd every-time, they say that I'm dilusional and it's not true and it's all in my head and that I'm making it up. I know I'm not. My older sister went through the same thing.\n\nThey claim that I need to see a psychiatrist because I'm paranoid. I'm not, I'm starting to stand up for myself.\n\nIt's like they can't admit they are wrong.\n\nWhat do I do?",

    "selftext": "I am 29M. I usually get furious if things don’t go my way. I swear a lot. I call profanities to my parents, God and everyone on this earth sometime. The anger usually gets over me and in that scenario I stop giving a fuck about anything or anyone and try to rectify the problem by shear force. While doing that I often end up hurting others or breaking things beyond repair. Like one day, the new screen protector of my iPad didn’t align properly. I got enraged and snapped it from the iPad with force and ended up putting a crack on the glass protector running from one end to other. I didn’t even use it. I took the whole thing and crushed it with my bare hands. Shards in thousands started falling on the floor like snow, along with the blood running loose from my hands. When I looked down, it was blood everywhere seeing which I felt good. I then took my smartphone and snapped it into two and threw it at the wall. I felt even better.\n\nThis is one of the usual cases. But I was not like this from the beginning. I remember every detail and every scene that made me this way. Like when I was around 7 or 8 and was taking a bath one evening. Maybe a drop flew and landed on the hot incandescent bulb and it blew up like a bomb. The only good thing was my luck that not a single piece of the bulb even scratched my body. The sound attracted attention. My mother came running and asked about what happened. It was dark inside and it scared me, so I opened the door. I told her I don’t know but the bulb just blasted I think. She pulled me out. I was naked, not even an underwear on me. She first slapped me hard on my face and then again and again. I cried and said I did nothing. My siblings watched. She then took a long hard stick and beat me with it, black and blue. I closed my legs together trying to hide my nudity as my hands were busy praying her to stop and assuring her that this won’t happen again. The fear was immense. The pain was immense. Tears couldn’t stop rolling down my eyes. And then she beat me some more. After she cooled down, she took me by the hairs and thrown me out of the house. I saw people coming and going. I tried hiding behind a wall. But even my friends saw, and they laughed. They laughed next day too. Well, this was the usual for me my entire childhood. If not her, it was my father and if not my parents it was my older brother. That’s when I understood that being youngest has its own demerits.\n\nMy mom is dead for some years now, but when she was alive, I asked about the bulb incident. She told me that sometimes we have to teach kids what is right, otherwise they will not grow up well. But she was wrong. My family has seen me grow stronger, independent and angrier. I go so angry nowadays that even my father is sometime afraid of me. My brother has grown to respect me and doesn’t even raise his voice in front of him.\n\nBut I never wanted this, and the journey I have taken for my survival was long and harsh. My parents used to fight often, like once every fortnight for my entire childhood. My mom tried to commit suicide often, like at least once every month. I tried a lot to make her understand, to not give up hope and stay rational. She taught me what fear is, but not by beating (that was more of a pain). The fear is when your mother locks herself in a room crying. There is no one to help you and you are too weak and little to do anything. All you can do is cry and watch from the window as she ties a noose from the fan. But she never did it. It was more like an attention seeking exercise; I read about it in an article. I don’t blame her. She didn’t have a happy life in her past. But this fear used to eat me from inside. When I was in college, I was so gloomy that I didn’t have any friends. I used to cry in the rain and walk in the dark. I used to hide on my hostel roof on my birthday so no one could find me as I used to sit in a corner and cry.\n\nWell, one thing led to another, and I was on drugs, which I used to do a lot. But in my opinion, that’s the best thing ever happened to me. I took acid and it kind of made me understand the life is about looking ahead and not behind. It made me understand how insignificant my problems are in the vast expanse of this universe. I have managed to put things behind and look forward. But this fear and anger became a part of my character which I am not able to change. I just need to learn some patience and I am hopeful things will change in the future.",

    "title": "My story of coming to terms with my anger, and finding my way forwards.",
    "selftext": "Hi there. Just found this sub and thought I would share my story of how I for the most part beat my rage, and became a better person. \n\nFrom as far back as I remember I had this \"beast\" inside me. My father was abusive and angry as well, so I guess I learned this behavior from his as a small child.  \n\nWhen I was in primary school and highschool, I constantly was bullied. I had no way of dealing with the pain and embarrassment and self hate this generated, so i bottled it up. Until some unfortunate classmate of mine or friend or teacher said the wrong thing at the wrong time and I would lash out. \n\nI remember being in 7th grade. My bottle was full of self loathing and hatred for the people who bullied me. My teacher in class noticed that I was having trouble and asked me what was wrong. when I wouldn't answer her, she grabbed my shoulder. That physical contact was the trigger that set off the explosion. I threw my texbook at her head, tripped her and pushed over my desk on her. I then proceeded to basically tear the entire classroom apart for about 15 minutes, overturning desks and throwing punches kicks and items at people until the teacher finally found a way to restrain me.\n\nThis is just one example of many. In this state it was like my conciouness was removed from my body and I was watching myself from behind this wall of rage and hatred. in this state i had no control, and no morals. I didnt care about the people in my way, just that I wanted to inflict as much harm as I possibly could on them until my rage was spent.\n\nI was constantly suspended, sent to the principals office and was constantly refered to many different psychiatrists and therapists. None helped me. \n\nAs I hit puberty and grew, the incidents became more serious. \nI remember a bully who triggered me in 10th grade so I tackled him to the ground in rage. I scratched and clawed at his face until my finger nails were bloody. I pulled his lip ring through his lip, and kicked him repeatedly in the balls. he was in the hospital for 3 days.\n\nI remember another time a few people were lying in the grass while i was walking by, seething from an earlier bullying incident. I could hear them laughing and talking about me. One said \"what a fag\". I snapped, ran over to him and kicked him in the side of the head like a soccer ball. he was knocked out cold and had a pretty severe concussion after that. \n\nObviously, this perpetuated a vicious cycle. People would bully me for my obvious awkward nature, and then I would bottle up my emotions until I snapped. which then lead to people bullying me for being insane. Rinse and repeat. at one point in highschool i was haivng about one outburst a month. The school was discussing my future with my parents almost constantly. It was only thanks to my phycologist and a few teachers who understood my predicament that I was allowed to continue, along with the fact that I was an A student.\n\nMy road to redemption started sometime around grade 9, when I discovered that there was a grand piano at my highschool that was open for anyone to play at any time. I had never touched a musical instrument in my life at that point. \n\nAs I had no friends, and was always a good student and finished my work as soon as I got it, I had a lot of free time. So I started to spend hours at the Piano. At first it was absolute garbage music. I didn't even know what i was doing. But over 4 years I got better and better. I started playing 8 hours a day. I fed my soul and my hatred and my loathing into the piano. I composed original songs and over 4 years, somehow the music I played gave me the release I had been craving for my entire life. I finally found a way to empty my bottle without it being a disaster. I found a creative release and eventually began to heal my soul. \n\nIt was still a rough road. I still lashed out. I continued to have outbursts until i was in 2nd year university, at 21, but they came less frequently and less intensely. I found a friend in university who took me as I was and helped me through unpacking the abuse my father had gave me as a child. \n\nI still had work to do though. I knew it. So i booked a ticket to New Zealand, got a work visa and took off into the world, leaving my shitty acting degree in the dust. \n\nIn New Zealand as a 22 year old, I found my freedom and myself. I know its cheesy, but when no one knows your past, your history of self destruction and just takes you as you are, life suddenly becomes a lot easier. while in NZ I became the person I always wanted to be. I found love, real love for the first time, and I smiled more than I ever had in my entire life. In my 1 year there I didnt punch a single wall, or a person for that matter. I finally had found my peace.\n\nComing home was rough. the people you have at home don't know this new person, and all the prejudice from before your travels is still there. they don't see the changes. And so I found myself fighting my rage again. \n\nbut this time I won. Though I could not get rid of it completely, through music, and a lot of yoga, i found my way forwards. \n\nMy rage is something i still live with today. Its still this little ball of heat in behind my stomach. I still get hot under the collar, but I haven't had an \"episode\" in 6 years. Id like to say Im free of it but \nI have had some very close calls where i had to excuse myself to go and find a piano. I know now that I am on the other side now and I can see the way forwards. I am in control now.  \n\nI also know I am lucky. I was on a path of self destruction that could have ended up with me in jail or worse. I am so thankful for music. It literally saved my life and changed me into a functioning person. \n\nTo all of you out there who are struggling to deal with your rage, know that if you find an outlet- whether this be sports, art, music or whatever floats your boat it can help ALOT. You can find your way forwards. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Travel, remove yourself from toxic environments and you will find a way forwards. \n\nto quote a great man, Red Green:\n\nKeep your stick on the ice. :)\n\nTL;DR: Was a pretty crazy child/teenager. Regularly exploded and beat the living shit out of people bullying me. Found music, Travel, and over many years let music heal my soul and give me an outlet for my rage. Travelling gave me the way to find out who I was without the rage and prejudice associated with it. Today I am free of outbursts.",

It will give us great trouble to do this for it is eager to burst force to kindle our eyes and to transform our face. But if you allow it to show itself to your outward appearance, it will become your master. Let it rather be locked in our inner most recesses of our breast and be born by us not bear us. Nay, let us replace all of its symptoms by its opposites let us make our countenance more composed than usual, our voice milder, our steps slower, our inward thoughts gradually become more influenced towards our outer demeanor.”\n\n-Lucius Annaeus Seneca",

    "title": "My top tips in managing anger. Read this to solve your issue!!!",
    "selftext": "Alright guys so what I’ve noticed in my 4 years on this subreddit is that our anger related issues usually comes down to either/both of these 2 things: 1. Impulsivity (reacting wayyy out of proportion, real fast) or, 2. Being full of resentment (just hating the world in general). This post will get some insight on things that will help you out over the long run.\n\n1. If you tend to overreact with anger and go from 0 to 100 really quick, then you WILL benefit a ton by tackeling your impulsive personality. The impulsivity towards actions greatly reflects the impulsivity towards reactions, so if you can manage to be less impulsive in your daily life then you will, at the same time, be less impulsive towards physically acting out on your emotions. As someone with ADHD, this tends to be a large issue in itself but Im working on it. How do I tackle this issue? Well, I make sure I wake up at the same time everyday and try to stick to my routine and schedule. This seems to be the most effective route currently.\n\n2. One of the greatest benefits I’ve experienced was from working out regularly. When I was a teenager I had “episodes” that repeated itself like every day. I would get myself unconsciously into a fit of rage, then fall asleep 20-50 min later due to my energy levels being depleted (yes, it literally was THAT bad) followed by waking up, only to end up feeling almost suicidal due to guilt and shame I felt afterwards. Working out regularly not only allowed me to gain a lot of muscle (we angry people perform VERY well in the gym!!) which inturn also brought more confidence and lowered anxiety, but it made my anger issues vanish for literally 80-90%. I kid you not!!!!!!\n\n3. Another extremely beneficial reason to work out regularly is that you get more aware on your diet. Ever heard about the importance of your “gut bacteria”? Yeah, me neither, until recently. It is said that our gastrointestinal system play a major role in our ability to regulate positive and negative emotion. It is kind of like a “second brain” according to neuroscientist. By eating the right foods you will develop a healthier “gut bacteria population” so to speak, which inturn indirectly help you stay calmer and less likely to explode. (IIRC, Neuroscience aint my field of expertise!)\n\n4. Drugs, alcohol, weed, cigarettes, coffee etc. etc. etc. Will only make things worse. If you could quit all drugs then that would most likely be the most healthy options. If you want a drug to make you feel less explosive, talk with your psychiatrist about mild anti-psychotics. (Ive heard great things about risperidon.) They have a record of helping people with impulsivity related anger issues. If you’re more filled with resentment, then you could to talk to your psychiatrist about anti-depressants. (Im no doctor!! Please talk with a professional first, and mention my recommendation to see if its applicable for you! Im in no position to  give out advice, just spreading awareness)\n\n5. Remove triggers at all cost. This is by far the easiest and most effective way. Literal immediate benefits from this one.\n\n6. The easiest trigger to remove, is to finally say/admit “Fuck videogames, they’re NOT worth it.” Only play the creative or slow paced ones. Dont fuck with competitive shit, I tell you, it is NOT worth it!!!!!! I know, it fucking sucks, but screw it man. Ditch those games and play something like stardew valley or minecraft or someshit.\n\n7. Learn to take shit from your close friends and family. if you get bullied at school or something, take out your anger on your bully in highschool if you have one (but try to not absolutely demolish him… obviously speaking). Do it to people who absolutely fucking deserve it, fighting someone is actually your way out of being bullied! but for the love of god DONT take it out on people you actually care about. This will continue to fill your resentment if you do this.\n\n8. Philosophize about self-awareness regularly. Try to implement this into your brain. This one is incredibly powerfull but will take a LONG time to adapt to. You NEED to teach yourself to remember “alright, I am starting to feel frustrated/annoyed/bothered again, I can still avoid it”. This is incredibly hard, as our brains like to turn off reasonable thinking once we start to get ourselves into a fit of rage. But it definitely is possible if you stay consistent.\n\n9. Try to reflect on what happened if you just had another episode. Write down what caused it, write down what accelerated it, write down what happened when you “peaked” and then write down how you felt during these three stages. This is very hard to do, and a psychologist might be of great use in giving insights on self-reflection\n\n10. And, most importantly, DONT BE SO HARSH ON YOURSELF. I often see this with people on here. We are so fucking harsh on ourselves, it is insane. No, you cannot sorta “redeem” yourself by being harsh on yourself. In order to “redeem” yourself you have to apologize to your close friends and family, express your emotions and try to “find a solution”. Especially to your mom, give her a reason to believe that you are motivated and able to fix your issue. Even if this is not the case, just tell her that you can eventually sort it out just to calm her down. This will subconsciously calm you down aswell.\n\n11. Meditate. I dont do this (I really should) but mindfullness and meditation allows your brain to be less reactive. I really should do it, but I cant get myself to do. If you are going to do this, listen to binaural beats. Only with binaural beats I can actually meditate.\n\nHope this will help. Thank you for reading",

It was fine enough to talk about it, and I understood what he was trying to say, and understand the point of meditation for regular people.\n\nBut I'm fucked up enough to think that me being in a simulation where scientists program bad things to happen to me until I snap to record results, isn't as improbable as it sounds anymore. Seems like the more I push through or get over, the bigger obstacles they hurl at me.\n\nSo two situations. I'm in a simulation and there's nothing I can do. In that case, i've started to flip a coin to decide how I'll react to negate their results.\n\n2nd situation - \"bad things happen to everyone, get over it, other people have cancer therefore you can't feel bad about anything unless it's cancer.\"\n\nIn the latter situation, anytime something bad happens to me, I record it and take it out on society or the offending person. Be it griefing online, physical vandalism, or a fight. I now carry pepper spray and a knife cause next time someone cuts me off and gives me the finger, I'm just going to kill them. Because guess what, I don't think I should suffer alone and all those \"healthy people\" can just \"get over it\" cause apparently bad shit happens to everyone right? So I have nothing to feel bad about. They probably deserve it anyway. No one is an angel.\n\nSomeone cuts me off or keys my car, and the therapist says I'm supposed to get over it and let the other person win? No, I'd rather die on a hill and teach someone a lesson at this point. I feel therapy and meditation is weak and admitting defeat. Someone breaks into my car and I should just get over it? Nah, I can pass the buck, slash someones tires, and they can get over it.\n\nNo, it doesn't get me my stuff back, but if everyone keeps touting \"get over it\" as mental health 101, then since it makes me happy, then it's a win win. Other people who keep telling me to get over it, can get over it.\n\nCMV? Doubt it. Feel I'm too far gone at this point. Yes raised by a physical and mentally abusive narcissist but how much can I keep blaming on genes and genetics. You'll probably see me in the news one day.\n\nI don't think bad things should happen to me. The amount of bad things that happen to me have been astronomically improbable. I've calculated them all.\n\nOther shit people have tried to say to me. \"You can't change the world\". Yeah I don't care. I'm not trying to change the world.

Don't tell me how i should feel.\n\n\"Bad things happen to everyone\". So whataboutism. Unless I'm a starving child with cancer and cleft pallet in africa, I should be lucky to be alive?\n\n\"it isn't worth getting this upset over\". This is fucking loser talk and this is why there are so many assholes in the world. Cause of appeasement. Besides, you can tell the person with their windows shattered \"lul get over it\".",

But on those other days, the days it chooses to be hungry, I can feel it clawing up my spine like a tree trunk. Waiting for its chance to strike. It feels like a dull hotness in the back of my mind that I can't turn away. \n\nIts victims are the only people in the world who matter to me. My son. My wife. My dog. It can pounce without warning. At a string of disobedience from my 6 month old dog. An instruction repeated to my 7 year old boy one too many times. A mistake made while I'm cooking dinner. A bad play at a board game. A driver making a dangerous and selfish move on the road. It's at that point, I think, that I begin to irrationally believe the world is out to get me. Stupid, senseless and juvenile. \n\nI become hot and my anger boils over. I become loud. Tense. Defensive. Relentless. Blind. I can't be consoled, and I'm usually left saying stupid and hurtful things that are wildly disproportionate to the issue. I might slam something on the table. I might swear. My eyes will smolder and I will replay the offense in a constant loop in my mind for the next 30 minutes. \n\nHowever, I'm never violent toward people, and I'm normally able to refrain from recklessly and selfishly insulting the people I care for. But of course the reaction is almost always unnecessary and leaves people hurt. Or dismayed. \n\nI'm weak. When I'm in the grips of it, I feel totally justified in my actions. Like somehow striking back at the imagined offense evens things out. I know it doesn't, but while I can restrain myself from lashing out to hurt someone, I can't seem to restrain myself enough to keep from causing pain. The insidious pain of living with someone who is volatile and feeling like you need to tiptoe around them to keep things calm. I know what I'm doing is wrong, even in the moment, but that voice isn't nearly as loud as the voice that says, \"keep going. This will make you feel better.\" \n\nI guess you could frame these outbursts as an unfortunate but tolerable personality flaw if they only happened once in a great while. But with me, it happens at least a couple times a week, and I'm ashamed to admit that I only explode near the people I love the most. Sometimes I'm poised to be angry all day. It's so corrosive and harmful to these relationships I value above everything else in life. \n\nMy wife is a sweet, gentle, and understanding person. My son is a good boy. A bit tough, sometimes, but he's an innocent kid with a soft, warm heart. My dog is a great dog, loving and loyal. They don't deserve my letting these outbursts get the best of me, slowly over time and over and over, until they permanently damage and destroy these relationships. \n\nAnd normally, I'm a pretty good guy. I want the best for people in life. I want people to be able to care for and support each other and I pride myself on being that for my friends. More often than not, I'm pretty mellow and can see both sides of a situation. I work in health care, and helping people feel comfortable when they are most vulnerable is a skill that I have honed to a fine edge. \n\nSo what am I doing? What's wrong with me? What is this switch that so easily gets flipped and I'm a completely different person? My life was hard growing up sure, but now I can say it's exactly what I'd hoped for. So why can't I stop needlessly lashing out? How do I fix this damage and more importantly, how... how do I stop this before more damage is done?\n\nIf you've gotten this far, I want it to be said that suggestions, especially book or podcast recommendations, commiserations, conversations and generally uninformed judgements are welcome.",

Was it because you were afraid that I wouldn't have helped you otherwise and that you've never trusted or valued my opinion at all?\n\n...so on and so forth. Cue argument. From my perspective, it just boggles my mind when people ask questions without thinking of the implications or the insinuations that come with the questions that they ask. *Why else would they ask such an inane question?*\n\nOf course, I know that this isn't my mom's intention when she asked me that simple question, but I cannot stop overthinking things, jumping to conclusions and taking them personally, especially with friends and family. To me, unlike complete strangers or acquaintances, they should know me better than anyone else.  \n\nIs there anything I can do to stop this when it's become so ingrained to the point of it being a reflex?",

There’s nothing anybody can say or do to change it and if they can it’ll take an immense amount of time and it usually gets worse before it gets better. She loses all sense of herself and is driven by her anger to say/do things that she doesn’t mean. And reasoning with her will get you no where. She’s a tough case to crack and is a lady of few words. \n\nUnfortunately my anger stems from disrespect, ungrateful acts and belittling, so her shutting herself out from me when she’s angry and only responding with attitude, it triggers me and it usually just sends things spiraling. \n\nI want to help her get control of her anger but I also wanna find out a better way to handle her anger, the best way possible, besides spending hours trying to talk sense into her. \n\nShe really is a down to earth girl, she’s just been through a lot.

    "selftext": "\n\nIf you need advice on ways to help manage anger or keep your cool I am here for you.\n\nThe best and easiest thing I have learned personally is to listen to more mellow music. That can be taken as cliche but it works because our subconscious mind takes everything we put into it and saves it for when it needs to be utilized. So listening to aggressive music all of the time can cause you to stay in the mental state. I find that crying with music also helps open up more emotions than jut sadness, it can be exhilarating honestly.\n\nAllow yourself to cry. If you find yourself locking up every emotion please please please and I can not stress it enough please allow yourself to cry. If you are like me and absolutely despise crying (or at the least worry about doing so in front of others) it is okay to. Crying is a natural human emotion. It is okay for you to feel the things that you lock up. And chances are someone will notice that anyways in you so please let it out. You are a stellar human with an astonishing capability to show your colors! Anyone is there for you to reach out to especially those you hold dearest or those that hold you dearest but you ignore. I promise I’m the end you have more friends then you think you do because you are worthy of it and deserve it no matter what!\n\nif you need someone to talk to period there are always those on the internet to look to for help. Even if it’s more than just anger there are people like you out there that WILL hear you out. If you just need to vent feel free to do so by Direct Messaging me or anyone who will probably comment on here aswell that they are here too. I know times are rough but we need to have eachother by the hand sometimes to feel better and that’s okay! If you do message me I swear on my life to keep it anonymous and between only us because I know feelings are to be kept to you. And I ask that with anyone else in this thread who wants to hear those out to please keep it anonymous! \n\nOne more tip: meditation\nIt doesn’t have to be the cross legged on the floor style. Really you can meditate however you want be it through gaming, laying in bed listening to music, picking up a book you love, or simply staring off into nature pondering its wonders. There are many ways to do so but always remember to breathe in and out and focus on your breaths each inhale. Allow yourself to be at peace and feel content!\n\nI love you all and I hope you heard that today from someone you care about and if not that’s okay too! Don’t ever feel like you aren’t loved however because there are plenty of people in the world you have and will meet that will tell you!\n\nLastly, never be afraid of who you are! You are human like the rest of us! Don’t be angry at yourself because you are only allowing your demons to swim! \n\nTake care everyone, and please find your happy for the day!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nFound this sub and figured I'd post here on a throwaway.\n\nI've had anger problems for most of my life. My guess is that it came about from my dad, who had his own temper problems and could be very raging at times. To myself, my mom, other people, etc. I imagine I picked up more from him than I'd like to have, but you can't change your childhood and can only do what you can in the now.\n\nI've noticed a pattern in my anger: it's always, or almost always, involving something not going right, something unexpected, or something beyond my control. I know the logical thing is not to worry about it and focus on solving the problem. And while I do address the problems, I still find myself getting upset. Think clenching and gritting teeth, breathing rapidly through my nose, and occasionally snapping at people if I'm not in a good. It's gotten me in trouble at work and I started seeing a therapist that other family members saw. She gave me workbooks, tried coping exercises such as breathing, etc.\n\nHowever, I don't think it worked. The workbook activities made sense, but it's extremely difficult to remain calm when things seem to spiral out of control. I tried the breathing and mindfulness exercises, but I've found that more often than not it ends up where you're brooding about the problem or whatever upset you. I had eight free sessions with the counselor/therapist via insurance, and at the last one, after I had another meltdown/outburst, she recommended looking into seeing a psychiatrist and possibly getting medication of some sorts. My mom suggested Lexapro at one point.\n\nHas anyone else felt like anger is essentially impossible to control, like it's a biological self defense mechanism to prevent others from walking on you? Like it's an old genetic code from the Stone Age where if you weren't worrying about something in your surroundings, you'd get eaten or maimed by the saber tooth tiger. I keep hearing about how anger management can help, but it seems to work better in theory than practice. Sometimes I feel like I'd need the therapist to be there in the office or wherever with me to keep me from melting down and getting upset when a trigger pops up.\n\nI should probably mention that I'm Aspergers/high end of the autistic spectrum, so maybe that fits into it somehow. Based on my research I think I may also have intermittent explosive disorder, which my therapist suggested may be correct, although she can't make a diagnosis.\n\nThanks for reading.

    "title": "Anger Masks Pain",
    "selftext": "I’ve been doing some research and reflection on the subject of anger lately.\n\nAnger is a self-preservation mechanism.  When we are physically wounded, we shield the wound from the dangers of the outside world with a bandage.  When we are emotionally or psychologically wounded, we shield the wound with anger.  Anger makes us appear powerful, dangerous, and dominant.  But it is mostly a display, a social signal, similar to animals puffing their fur out to appear larger.  True power and control comes from a place of maximum health and resilience, but anger only erupts when we are emotionally or psychologically weakened.\n\nThis is a useful instinct.  If someone threatens our comfort or happiness - an intruder into our home, a con-man seeking to take advantage of us, an abusive partner - it is not safe to show vulnerability and weakness.  Showing weakness in a dangerous situation often shows our adversary just where to strike, just where we hurt the most.  So anger allows us to conceal and compensate for the weakness, both to our tormentor and to ourselves.  It is similar to how adrenaline masks pain, to allow us to escape the circumstances that caused a severe physical injury.  Anger gives us the time and willpower to find a way to escape the circumstances that caused a similar emotional/psychological injury.\n\nHowever, there is danger in over-reliance on this instinct.  Imagine you are in the wild, running from a tiger.  You fall and hurt your legs badly.  Adrenaline and other self-preservation instincts allow you to ignore - to not even notice - the extent of your injuries and to continue running.  However, once you are safe, it is imperative that you stop and tend to your wounds.  Imagine if we had more conscious control over these physical effects.  Imagine if we could convince our body to continue secreting adrenaline.  If we were to stop secreting it, we would begin to feel the severe pain seep into our consciousness.  Pain is designed to instill avoidance in us.  When something hurts, it is an almost irresistible reflex to avoid the trigger of that pain.  So if we could consciously control the release of adrenaline and endorphins, most of us would instinctively release them at the first sign of pain.  The result of this is that we would have no physical signal telling us to stop, to face the harsh reality of our injuries, to rest, to tend to them.  If you were to rely on physiological masking of pain, it would be very easy to convince yourself that you were strong, that you were not actually injured, and that there was nothing that needed to be fixed in your body.\n\nAnger, for better or worse, does fall much more in the realm of conscious control.  It is based on experience, expectations, the stories we tell ourselves in our minds.  So when we have been somehow hurt, emotionally (being insulted, feeling disappointed) or psychologically (questioning our identity, questioning our deeply-held beliefs), it is almost inevitable that many of us will attempt to escape that pain and discomfort using anger.  Once we have successfully masked our pain with anger, we are very resistant to releasing it.  Releasing the anger lets in the pain, and we are hard-wired to avoid pain.\n\nI have found myself in situations where I was sitting alone in a room, tormented by anger of a situation that had no real bearing on my life (something someone said online, perhaps, or some little gadget breaking).  In these situations, I have known that everything was actually okay, and that the anger and strength of that emotion was not useful to me.  And unlike fear and sadness, ‘leaning into’ the anger - that is, allowing myself to be overcome with it and not fighting it - did not seem to help.  If anything, it seemed to breed stronger anger, and encourage me to be more reactive to similar small annoyances.\n\nHere is the answer to letting go of your anger: Anger masks pain.  Letting it go hurts, so our instinct is to not let it go.  It feels like betraying ourselves, like letting someone else win or take advantage of you.  It feels like getting duped or conned.  It feels like injustice.  But if you don’t let it go, it will be very hard to identify the source and depth of our pain, so it will be nearly impossible to treat it.\n\nThere are many situations where anger is a healthy and appropriate response.  But it is important to assess whether you are *actually* in immediate physical or psychological danger, or whether the trigger for your anger is actually due to erroneous beliefs, subconscious fears, old emotional wounds, or unfulfilled (possible unreasonable) expectations.  If you are not in real danger, it is important to remind yourself that “Anger masks pain,” and to try to identify the source of the pain within yourself.  What are you afraid of?  What were you wrong about?  What scary or painful beliefs about yourself or the world are carrying?  What truth have you been hiding from yourself?\n\nA cool side benefit of this is that letting go of anger is contagious.  When you stop puffing up your fur, most people around you will stop puffing up as well, especially people of average-to-good psychological health.  When you make yourself vulnerable and show your pain, show your fragility, it inspires in others a caretaking, nurturing instinct - they may be hurting too, but the nurturing instinct is just as strong as the anger instinct, and being cared for in times of pain *actually* helps to heal the wounds in our hearts and our minds.\n\nAnd being free from pain feels so much better, deep inside, than masking it ever could.",

I live in a rural area with little available as far as mental health services, and most shrinks are far too expensive for me anyway. \n\n  The other day I was thinking, as I often do, about how much I hate the human race. It makes me sick that we're going to Mars after the shit show we caused on earth. We're a parasitic species designed to spread our destruction across the galaxy. I hate us as a race, and I hate us as individuals, for too many reasons to list. I don't really believe anyone is overall a \"good person.\" I believe we all have good and bad attrbutes but regardless, the sickness of humanity is inside us all. \n\nAs I pondered this another idea came to mind: maybe serial killers were the good guys. Given how trash of a race we are, isn't the elimination of its members a good thing? And if we were meant to live in peace, we would be doing it by now. Killing has been a part of our existance since the dawn of time. \n\nI've become afraid of myself and my thoughts. I do bad things and feel no remorse. There was a time when I found my partner's ex on social media and, knowing they have depression, told them they should commit suicide. Even though I knew objectively that this was wrong, a larger part of me said yes, I do want them to kill themselves. The only reason why I wouldn't want them dead is because my partner would mourn them and then my anger would compound. \n\nI have more than once felt extreme rage and have felt straight-up homicidal. All I could think about was how easy it would be to slit the person's throat, and it took every ounce of effort in my body to remain calm. \n\nI have meditated a lot on my anger and tried to find the true cause of my feelings. I do NOT want to kill, and, despite my contradictory thoughts about it, I think murder is an abominable act. I am absolutely terrified that someday I will snap and hurt someone...or worse. Then I'll go to jail for the rest of my life, forced to live with what I've done. \n\nIf anyone has ANYTHING that could help I am desperate. I am terrified of myself and my thoughts. I think I should commit suicide, or just run away and live by myself. Why am I like this? Why do I have to feel this way?",

    "selftext": "I don't know if this is a case of me projecting my anger problems onto him so looking for some insight here. I personally think I have more of poor frustration tolerance manifested as anxiety and he is the one with low tolerance of my anxiety and manifests as anger. We also fight differently where he needs time to cool off and I want to hash it out immediately. My issue with giving him time is that 1) he refuses to set a limit to that \"time\" and sometimes it'll be days before he wants to speak to me and 2) I get more angry and anxious the more time passes and by the time he's ready to talk to me, I'm sometimes more upset than I was to begin with.\n\n Just an example of an incident that happened recently, resulting in my boyfriend telling me I need to fix my anger problem-\n\nMy boyfriend works long hours 6 days a week and on his off day, I was trying to deal with a $500 Amex gift card that I just noticed lost. I didn't even have any of the card info so I was very flustered and anxious that the money was lost. However, I knew he wouldn't want to deal with this so I went into the other room to call customer service and let him watch TV in peace but he was apparently still able to hear me. I was talking to the service rep when he barges into my room, interrupts my conversation and starts yelling at the rep. I put us on mute and told him that he can't yell at these reps. He barges off and lets me deal with it. After the situation was resolved, I go to him and ask why he did that. Apparently I was asking him in an annoying accusatory way (his words) because within less than a minute, he walks out of the room and tells me to shut up and leave him alone. At this point, I'm riled up so I followed him and kept talking at him. He told me to stop yelling and I immediately apologized for raising my voice and started speaking more calmly but all he wanted was me out of his face. After less than 5min (I know this because I looked at when I hung up with the rep), I angrily say that he was the one who got mad first and that I would be downstairs once he's ready to apologize. He did apologize about 2hrs later but continued to claim that I started it and also sassily said how I ruined his one day off, all of which ticked me off so another argument ensued.\n\nMy breakdown of what happened is that I became noticeably anxious, he wasn't in any mood to deal with this anxiety even if not directed at him and wants to be left alone, I however needed to vent my frustration at his handling of the situation and in my opinion what was his fault, and when he delivered a 2hr late sass laden apology that was not to my liking, I continued to be angry. \n\nWhat is the solution? It's hard for me to just drop it as it doesn't even seem like he understands that he also did something wrong. Is he being reasonable in his request that I'm never allowed to show my anxiety over stuff like this and go to him with it? From where I'm standing, he could have very easily resolved this situation immediately by nicely saying that he was tired, thought I needed help with this issue and apologize for yelling at the rep.",

Actually she wasn't just unhappy, she was vocally getting angry. I stayed calm, and told her that I wasn't going to engage her if she's in the heat of being angry. She pressured me towards discussing the dogs, but I declined.

Tonight we got close to finishing recording one of the videos, but before we could one of my friends got a call that he had to go pick up his brothers from work. I had an outburst saying how stupid this was, that we just had two or three fucking shots left and it would take 10 minutes tops, etc. \n\nI walked home thinking about why I acted like this. Everyone else was probably irritated too, but they were chill and just said we will finish up the video some other time.\n\nIm pretty sure I know why I am like this. For reference, I am 18 years old. The causes of my irritability started around 10-12 years ago.\n\nFor one, I've always been the smallest kid in my class. I'm a 5'3 guy, which is pretty humiliating. In elementary school, I was extremely sensitive. I would cry over quite literally everything - if I had to switch seats away from a friend, I'd just break down and start sobbing. That kind of shit. I also had a hard time making said friends, as you can imagine. I would ask some guys during recess if I could join their tag game, and they would kindly decline, saying they had too many people in already. I would immediately start crying and tell a teacher they were bullying me, and they would believe it. I told my parents this as well. They still don't know that I was lying about it.\n\nThis grew to them actually bullying me by making fun of my height and such. I grew out of this by the 5th grade. Ever since, I have always felt incredibly insecure over my size. I feel rather useless in terms of dating, and that I will never find true love unless someone settles for me, because who would want to be with a 5'3 guy?\n\nI also feel like I'm simply not good at anything. This ranges from at worst feeling like I am the absolute worst at everything I do, to at best feeling like I am just never the best at anything compared to all my friends and acquaintances. This ranges from video games, music, other forms of art, everything. I'm never the best at anything, and I get mad at those who I perceive as better, especially if I think they perceive me as lesser. It's gotten to the point where I often send hate mail to people who beat me online in video games. I rage literally every time I am killed. It's very difficult for me to admit being wrong and/or apologizing. I always have to have the last word - I simply cannot be viewed as lesser.\n\nThis is especially the case with the friend I got pissed at earlier. He always seems to have his life much more put together than everyone. His family is very well off, he has a beautiful girlfriend and a great relationship, he is going to college for next to nothing, he's already planning on moving out, he makes good amounts of money already, etc. The jealousy is real with this.\n\nI think the last thing worth mentioning is that I always feel like an extremely unlucky person. Part of it goes back to my height - I'm often told I have a great face and style but that my height just kills me. I could've been so much more had I at least had been of average height. I also play a lot of RNG based video games, and tend to be pretty unlucky with those as well. And just tiny things as well: I'd be listening to a music playlist with multiple artists, and I'd tell myself \"the next song will not be by x artist\", and the next song would be by that artist. Of course, it's likely that this is all just confirmation bias. But because of how long this has been going on, it's very hard for me to imagine that.\n\nMy online presence (besides the video games I mentioned earlier) tends to be very nice and respectful. I think this is because online people don't have a concept of me already made, and therefore don't view me as a lesser or are aware that I am, indeed, lesser (or at least that's what my mind makes me believe). I truly wish to extend this persona to real life.\n\nSo yeah. I need therapy.\n\nTl;dr: deeply rooted insecurities, a strong aversion to admitting wrong-doing, and a real sense of being supremely \"unlucky\" have caused me to become a very irritable person, and, I hate to admit it: a toxic friend.",

I felt nothing. Of course I was worried about my partner but beyond that I couldn't feel anything else. When my roommate was yelling at my partner I didn't stand up to him, I just froze.

    "selftext": "I've come to realize I have extreme anger issues. I tend to blame it on my childhood - the only emotion my parents showing being anger and they always lashed out, verbally and physically - but no matter where it comes from, I need to stop it. I cannot handle any type of negative feedback, or even healthy criticism tbh, because my brain is like, set it permanent defense mode from trying to survive my first 18 years. Im now 19, been out of the house and away from those people for exactly a year now and they still control me. Anytime me and my partner get into any argument (arguments usually stemming from me overreacting and then he gets defensive and calls me names and then i go into complete defense attack mode) I just yell and hit things, lately I have been throwing things, and mock. I have tried to implement strategies such as expressing he is pushing me or just being quiet but then he says I am ignoring him. I tend to say \"I dont care\" on repeat when I feel an argument is going no where and that makes him get on my ass even more but it's not true, I don't know why I say it. I have also come to a tendency to hit him (I know, i'm so sorry.) if he is too close to me/touches me when I'm anger and he is saying things that push me. I hate it and it makes me feel like absolute shit but it's like my brain truly thinks it's a proper reaction and so I just ... do it. with little thought. and definitely no thought towards any consequences from it. I want to stop so badly. I'm genuinely a sweet girl with a strong hatred of violence but when i'm anger, that's it. game over. I've read some tips on how to try calming yourself down and going about it as a level headed person but in the moment, I never can remember those things and implement them properly. I just scream \"you're pushing the fuck out of me\" \"I don't care\" \"leave me alone\" on repeat and I don't think that helps the situation. I just don't know what to do. I wish he would work with me on recognizing my anger and not pushing me so much - i've even told him I just need some time to chill out because I obviously cannot handle it in the moment but he says he doesn't want to wait and that it would feel awkward for him to bring it up at a different time- but that doesn't seem to be a thing yet he, and no one in my future, deserves this. I'm just at a loss. I feel so helpless and truly just angry at my parents for not providing me with proper ... anything. But I know I can't change the past, or them, so I just need to work on myself .... but I don't know where to begin. \n\nbtw - I am autistic. No intellectual disability but I have a difficult time processing overwhelming stimuli in any situation and overall reading peoples emotions/social situations properly. A combo of this, my traumatic excuse for a childhood, and my anxiety & depression and it's just a shit show for arguments ....",

    "title": "I actually found a pretty good method to controlling my anger.",
    "selftext": "So first, some backstory. I got several notifications from the Instagram group chat I’ve been in with some of my friends, and they were spamming shit like crazy. Annoyed, I decide to check what the hell they’re sending. And one of the guys in the group chat who regularly tends to act like a dick was talking some shit about me, and another guy jokingly joined in. This pissed me off a bit, but I decided to just send a funny messed up meme directed at one of them as a response. If the stupid app just worked like it should, I would’ve left it at that and moved on. I might’ve still been annoyed, but I wouldn’t have acted on it that much. But no. The app decides to refuse to send the meme to the chat for some unbeknownst to me bullshit ass reason, and it ended up making me feel worse. \n\nMy thoughts were pretty much: Oh that’s just fucking great! Everyone else can send all this other shit but I can’t do a damn thing because fuck me, right?! Why should I be able to respond the same way they can, right?!\n\nAnd these thoughts only got louder and angrier the more the app didn’t work. \n\nEventually, I got more pissed than I had any right to be. And I ended up saying some shit that I shouldn’t have said after one of the guys who said the thing that annoyed responded in this way that made things worse. I can’t really describe it.\n\nAfter I came back to the chat after an hour or so to calm down, I was quick to own up to what I did. I apologized as needed, and I even temporarily left, because I really felt like I needed a break from it. \n\nThe day after that happened, I posted to this sub that I was frustrated with how my anger keeps making me second guess myself and make me think I should’ve been more aggressive in this situation and that one. After I posted that, I got really pissed at my angry side, and decided to pretty much stand up to it in my mind.\n\nTo elaborate on that, you know how in the final level of Manhunt 2, the main character fights this serial killer that made his way into his subconscious? Eventually beating him to death in his own head? Well I pretty much did that to my angry side, and my god, it felt cathartic.\n\nI beat the shit out of him, and called him out for all the shit he kept persuading me to do. All those awful thoughts he put in my head, all those murderous fantasies he concocts inside my thoughts, all the times in which he made things significantly worse, and I even called him out for all those times in which I really needed his aggression in very specific situations, and he did nothing but back down like the little pussy he was.\n\nI outright said he was useless, that he was taking up space. And I didn’t get anywhere near as angry as he usually does, even though I was kicking him around like a broken vending machine. It felt good beating that little belligerent cowardly loudmouth down. I even locked him away in a cage I subconsciously created, and told him that from now on, I call the fucking shots. Not you. And if you ever forget that, I’ll beat your ass back into the cage, you goddamn animal. \n\nI believed every word I said. He was and still is useless, and he is a coward. I can do all the things he can without escalating shit. And I can do it better. And let me tell you, that was the best thing I’ve ever done for myself lately.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, he still tries to regain control, and on occasion he does succeed, but I’ve always been able to take it back. He doesn’t have anywhere near the influence he used to. And I don’t let him control me that much anymore. He may not be completely locked away, but he sure as shit ain’t the warden. This time I am. And anytime he steps out of line, I knock his ass back into it, even if it takes me a little longer sometimes.\n\nThe moment I did that is the moment I realized that I’m really nothing like that angry prick. I’m a lot quieter, and way less willing to lose my shit. Problem is, when things get too hectic or stressful, he does try to retake the wheel on the ship that is my mind. But I am still working at consistently keeping control. For instance, when I was playing a game and kept dying, he came out and started throwing a fit. And I responded by punching him the goddamn face and firmly telling him to shut the fuck up. That he isn’t helping.\n\nBut yeah. Just wanted to share this. I still have my lows, don’t get me wrong. But the moment I personified my anger, is the moment it became easier to deal with. I didn’t do that to avoid taking responsibility for my actions, I just did it to convince myself that I’m better than my anger. That my angry self and my real self are 2 different people. And one deserves to be captain more than the other. But yeah. Just thought I’d share my story, even if it is a bit ridiculous lol",

I admired their (*I’d prefer to use gender neutral pronoun here) personality. Who they were. I thought they were interesting and I wanted to be there for them. I wasn’t too angry most of the time and I would be ok with how we would communicate. They were very open with me, as I was with them. We would share our sadness and joy. This was a real friendship to me. \n\nI am in a very low part of my life and I have a harder time controlling my anger, and I have a lower threshold for becoming angry too. So last week, they were the victim of my poor anger management. I insulted them out of the blue, for anger I felt towards another person. Their reply to me was shocking. They knew I was angry. They told me to manage it better. They told me they were scared for my other friends/family and that I was dangerous. \n\nYou see, usually I would just get more angry. I would deny it. I would pretend they are in the wrong and I would convince myself of this. \n\nNot this time. This time I lost my only, and best, friend. And I gain consciousness of my issue. I visualised all my life as if I was moment from dying and it all clicked. All along, the reason why I struggle so much in life, all these fights, this hatred, this loneliness, these cries. \n\nI’m just angry and I can’t control it. \n\nBut now I know, and I feel stronger and hopeful. This is what i have to work towards and this is what needs to change. Not my taste for movies or my fashion choices. My anger. \n\nThank you if you have read all of that, I really wanted it out.

We just had a child together and i know he’s under a lot of pressure but i can’t take walking around on eggshells with his constant attitude, I think it’s been worse since he’s sleep deprived a bit.  He’s very unhappy and minor inconveniences stress him out much more than the average person (I don’t know how else to put Thisbe ), to him a diaper change turns into an end of the world scenario causing him great distress and he will start yelling and cursing and it puts me into a panic attack hearing him get like that. he’s changed a lot over the years overcoming a lot of negative behaviors he had from living with his family like road rage etc but this attitude and anger has become a constant thing in his daily life and it’s making our relationship suffer, I can barely talk to him or ask him to do a small task without wishing I wouldn’t have to avoid him getting frustrated and worked up.

I take my heart and lay it out before you, with no expectation of whether or not you will receive it. My goal is to be honest so that you and I both, whether together or separate in the long run, can heal from what I've done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor years I have been a monster. For years I have been entitled to get things my way by using wit and anger to manipulate conversation. I was only interested in getting my way despite proclaiming to be open-minded. In hindsight I am still trying to accept that I am manipulative, as I cannot always see what I was doing. I did not realize I was poisoning the grounds on which honest discussion took place until new discussion could no longer grow. I don't know how I could have been so abusive. The best way I can understand it is that a deceived mind does not know it is deceived. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been verbally and emotionally abusive. I have said things I don't wish to repeat for shame.  I have said apologies that did not last. I have said hurtful things that have scarred you deeply but I do not even remember. I have made a fool of myself even online. I know what I have done. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere there should have been a mental process that stopped me from being enraged, or perhaps return me to a better mood, there were nothing. My mind was an entitled pool of ideas that must happen. I was narcissistic not to learn self-control. Though it was not my intention to isolate you from support, it appears that is what has happened, allowing my abuse to continue with no oversight. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have thrown items in anger. I have lashed out at the world thinking it has no feelings so that its ok. I justified my actions because of pain from my past, not realizing that by my own actions I was causing you to live in that pain with me. I was blinded by my ambition for good. Good I was not. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have let my cannabis addiction make the situation worse. I believed myself self-medicating, but I was not careful with dosage and became a heavy user. I justified my smoking until my addiction became more important than our relationship. I promised to remove it from our life and I have not done so. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been asleep to my own madness. You have tried so many things to snap me out of it, but the only thing that could wake me was pain. My anger focused me so much that I could not see the big picture. The destruction I was causing became apparent only when you told me how much I have hurt you. I have been in denial that I am hurtful to you and that I have been careless with my words. I know now that I have been. I am sorry. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have spent my entire life controlled by a broken inner child trying to run away from harm. I need to reprogram my mind and be an adult now. I believe it is possible to heal from emotional abuse. In the general sense and specifically for you and me, if I am diligent and sincere about making radical changes. I will not make a fool out of you. I will get this right. I will prove my healing with action over time. I am trying to learn some new behaviors. I am going to practice this for the rest of my life. My healing is important to me. I want your healing to be important to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for being generous with me.",

    "selftext": "28F \n\nI've dealt with irritability since I was a teenager - I grew up with my grand parents and my grandfather has always had extreme anger issues. He still battles with this. As does my mother, who has untreated Bipolar. \nI don't like trying to justify why I'm like this, but my biological father really messed me up by never wanting to be in my life (first child) but has three other kids from someone who he's been a great dad to.\nMy mother is a narcissist, but I can't begin to get into that. And my grandfather is so amazing, but has such severe anger problems. My grandmother is just amazing and how she is able to suppress her stressors might not be the healthiest, but I still wish I could do it like she does.\n\nI've wrecked relationships because I get angry at trivial things, and my relationship with myself most importantly is not healthy because of it.\nSomething simple as my food not tasting good, or being too cold can put a rock in my chest - which is absurd. Yesterday, I was doing my homework and I accidentally lost what I was writing and I yelled in an empty house. I got so stressed and it just feels like so many little, ridiculous things set me off.\n\nIn my current (and previous) relationships I get upset when my partner wants to go out with friends and I can't because of school/work/mood, or I don't want to see friends... But I want to *want* to see and hang out with friends. Same thing if he wants to have his friends over when I'm at work... Why would this be an issue? It shouldn't be. I get so frustrated with him because he wants to go and have fun and that is not okay. And even though I understand that it's me, I can't seem to stop the feeling in my chest. \nThis happens with all kinds of things, but it never seems to be an issue with friends or if I'm in a new relationship. I just seem to get overwhelmed, anxious, and become angry. \nWhich is a factor I think. When I get anxious, I don't know how to not turn that into irritability. I also feel stressed. Small things that shouldn't matter do, so when things that are big and warrant stress just make it feel never ending. \n\nI've been on SSRIs for depression, I'm currently on ADHD meds and even though they help me so much, they can add to my irritability. I've been to therapy plenty of times, but never too really focus on this issue - I guess I have many.\n\nI am a self conscious person when it comes to relationships. I do have a bad fear of abandonment. When my partner wants to hang out with friends and I'm not able to be there, my stress comes from being anxious that he has more fun without me. Which, why wouldn't he if I'm such a downer? \nI think something's contribute to my fear of being abandoned. But I grow that possibility by being the way I am. \n\nI feel lost. I feel lousy and I am so ashamed of myself. I want to be a calmer person, but even with my understanding of how irrational I am I can't stop the feelings. It's like my anger makes me think that it's justified at the time, and either I can't see that I'm being ridiculous until after, or during but can't subdue it. I can't take being this way anymore.\n\nThis was a ramble, I'm sorry for not being concise. I just didn't know where to start.",

Shit is about to get real.\n\nSo when I was 15, my mother and step-dad had me arrested for smoking marijuana in the house. That same day, they packed up all of my belongings and sent them to my dad's apartment where I have been living for the past 4-5 years. A week after this incident occurred, I was court ordered to take a psych evaluation since the judge saw that I was in therapy and thought that there was an underlying cause for my actions. When being tested for Bipolar Disorder, the specialists recommend that you should be between the ages of 18-25 since your brain has almost fully developed. Well, with that being said, the psychiatrists said that I needed to take the exam since I was \"a special case.\" Teenagers are supposed to be moody and irritable and a bit rebellious... But the doctors saw a side of me that was apparently uncommon with someone my age. I took the test and they determined that I was indeed Bipolar. Here's the part that fucks me up the most... I was medicated for 3 years until I could not take it anymore. The medications made me feel like I was simply just there. I had no emotion, no feeling, and I was numb to my core. I would occasionally have an \"episode\" every once in awhile after I stopped treatment, but then again, I was still a teenager going through the motion of High School and hormone change. Fast forward to 2 months ago... I went in for another evaluation since I had not had any problems with the disorder for almost a year and a half so I decided to retest... Y'all... The same fucking doctor said \"Oh dear... It appears that we tested you too soon. You have made significant amounts of improvement and it appears that you just have high levels of anxiety and mild depression.\" I AM FUCKING LIVID. The same doctor who put me on medications that altered my fucking personality told me that she made a fucking huge mistake. It's too late for me to sue. It's too late for me to go back in time and speak my mind. It's too late for me to stop the medications from melting my brain. This lady destroyed my life. I was 15. I had so much going for me. I cannot join the marines now since I have taken prescription drugs. I cannot join law enforcement because of the same reason. The things that I fucking loved were taken away from me at such a young age and I will never forgive her.\n\n3 of my friends use her as a physician and I believe that she needs to have her license revoked since they have had issues with her as well.\n\nDO NOT GO UNHEARD IN YOUR MEETINGS.

It seems to give us direct access to our egos, where we feel an inflated sense of power and entitlement. We no longer feel vulnerable, we see things in black and white terms. We believe we are right. But in this primitive state of excitement, we are reacting from the animal level and our grown up brain has been bypassed. this kind of habitual reaction can leave a lot of damage in it's aftermath. It undermines our dearest relationships and our own self-respect.\n\nWe need to examine our patterns with anger. We don't seek to be rid of it but to manage it as adults. Do we take responsibility for staying honest in the midst of anger? Can we hold on to our humility while being angry? When we express angry feelings do we avoid abusive words and intimidating actions? We can feel our anger and express it without reverting to our primitive brain.",

    "selftext": "Someone kept pushing and pushing me, and instead of lashing out or trying to put them in their place, I let them talk themselves out before simply walking away.\n\nI have a particular thing about emotional manipulation. It triggers me due to past abuse, and usually it's a very easy way to get a rise out of me. In the past, I would start saying some vicious and even threatening things back just to shut them up. But I can't be that man anymore. I have to have standards now, even if the person across from me doesn't.\n\nSo when they started running through all the standard narcissist's tricks - guilt tripping, victim carding, \"you're the only one\" - I simply sat back, put on some music, and let them talk themselves dry. Funny thing about these people is they aren't very creative and have almost no self awareness. They repeat themselves a lot and give up their own game. Once you're onto them, they stop being threatening and just start looking...kind of sad. And not worth your time.\n\nSo I walked away from that relationship for good. No fights. No screaming matches. Just a short and simple goodbye. And it feels good. I used to think rage gave me power, but from the outside all I looked like was a giant toddler. This, though? Now *this* is podracing. I've been exercising and playing sports again recently, and I really do think they've made a big difference in how I carry myself.",

    "selftext": "Just a little context - growing up my so called friends were aware I had anger issues. And they would frequently try to push my buttons because they thought it was funny to see someone go into absolute rage mode. It also didn't help I was bullied growing up as well so I have quite a bit of emotional baggage and trauma. But even today in my late 20s I still have difficulty containing my anger. I do believe 100% of my anger is letting others get under my skin. I think a lot of this is because I never had someone who would stand up for me growing up. Whenever I was bullied people would blame both sides, and not blame the bully for being a bully. Even my parents did this and would blame me for it too. My parents are not bad people, they just didn't understand then. However telling them about it now they tell me they wish they were more understanding, and often blame themselves but I tell them to not blame themselves. \n\nI really just don't know what to do anymore. I find myself losing it during online gaming as well. It's not the game itself, but it's other players who make me angry and get under my skin. Earlier today I nearly snapped the controller in half because I was so angry some dude was hacking and ruining my experience so I lashed out and got angry. But then of course he had a bunch of friends in the lobby who ganged up on me and started making fun of me. I should have left, but I didn't. I stayed and fought with them and just got angrier. I ended up leaving the lobby and threw a can of red bull across the room. This is just a minor example. It's why I don't use social media anymore as well because when I did use social media I would often get into very heated exchanges relating to politics and sometimes sports. (Yes I know that's stupid). \n\nThe good thing is I am fairly reserved in person. But for some strange reason I have a bad habbit of allowing people thousands of miles away to get under my skin.",

In fact, I don't physically feel anything. My facial expression remains calm and I become silent and more dissociative. The \"anger\" is colder and trapped deep in my subconscious, buried under almost impenetrable layers of mental armor.\n\nThe only hint that I'm experiencing \"anger\" are that my thoughts will gradually become more violent and random. I tend to obsessively replay acts of violence in my head whenever someone says something backhanded to me, or whenever I'm yelled at or inconvienced. I used to get weird nightmares and gruesome visions whenever my load of unprocessed anger began to overflow. Only then would I snap and become extremely physically violent. Unfortunately, I only experience this sweet, sweet catharsis very rarely.

Even now when I say I get angry it is all in my mind or behind closed doors because I am afraid If I show my displeasure I will push more people away.\n\nAnd the anger I get is totally disproportionate to the cause. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Today my professor refused to give attendance because my mike was not working, so I wanted to find him and kill him with a bat.\n2. Last semester when another faculty was bieng a pain in the ass and doing nothing but yelling for small things, I wanted to torture his kids infront of him.\n3.

It's like his \"fight vs flight\" part of his brain takes over and over-rides his prefrontal cortex. \n\nI've found that if I can get him to stop ranting, then he usually calms down and apologizes for getting angrier than necessary. However, I can't always get him to stop.

He becomes a different person when he's angry and it's damaging to our relationship.\n\nWe had a discussion recently and I asked him if he could think of any solutions for him to stop ranting so that he doesn't transition into full-blown explosive anger. I said if there was a scale of 1-10 for anger, I'd like him to learn to stop once he gets to a 3. Otherwise if he gets to a 5-6, he's very likely to escalate to a 10. He got a bit defensive at this point, and said he couldn't think of any solutions. \n\nI know there must be strategies that can help, but I don't know what they are. Does anyone have any resources or ideas that have worked for them?  And secondly, is there a way to bring up these ideas without him getting defensive?

    "selftext": "I've been working from home for the last 4 months, like most of us. It has been good in a way, because I save money on gas and don't have to deal with traffic. It has hindered me because I lived with roommates who are not all there. The owner of the house is a complete slob and a drunk, and extremely forgetful. He'll microwave lasagna without taking it out of the box and then forget it's in there, and I'll find it the next day when I need to go use the microwave. Food and dirty dishes get left out all the time. The kitchen is covered in a layer of grease, which I have tried to clean but it just gets greasy again and I'm constantly cleaning up after him or another roommate.\n\nAnother roommate insists on having 2 vehicles, and with COVID quarantine, the neighbors got stressed out about our vehicles parking in front of their houses. If the roommate would just do the right thing and store his second vehicle somewhere else, we could all park easily. Same thing with the owner, he has a 99 Chrysler 300M that he thinks is worth keeping, even though it won't start now and has a bad transmission. He claims it has a \"Prowler engine\" and \"Police engine\" in it, and with a new tune can do 160mph. It's  3.5L V6 that has never been used as a performance engine, and is notoriously unreliable.\n\nThe neighbors left us a note not to park in front of their house, but did it anonymously, so the roommate with the 2 vehicles ( who is not very bright) replied to it saying we don't respond to anonymous threats, and left it in the next door neighbor's mailbox, acting as the owner. That blew up when the owner found out, too, but the roommate is mad at me for letting it slip, instead of taking responsibility for it (he's 57 years old but acts like a spoiled 12 year old). Our mail also got held twice because the mailbox was blocked, and none of the other guys (3 others living here) had the motivation to figure out where to go pick it up.\n\nAll that has happened in the 4 months I've lived here, and it's just stressful because the 2 vehicle roommate is just one of those high-strung people, smokes pot a lot, which I don't care about except that it's still illegal here and could make all of our lives miserable, and he keeps a loaded pistol with him. As irrational and unhinged as he is, that concerns me.\n\nThe stress of all this has kept me on edge, and today when I left to go to the dentist, I got out of the house in a bit of a hurry, since I spent too much time looking for something online that I thought would be quick to buy off Amazon again but was sold out. In hindsight I should have just walked away and waited until later. Driving in this area is a bit stressful, and I ended up getting frustrated on several occasions on the way to the dentist. \n\nThus my screen name.  I'm acting like a spoiled petulant child throwing a temper tantrum.\n\nI've gotten so much better at dealing with stressful situations. I just wish there was a way I could turn it off, put it aside, something, when I'm in the heat of the moment like that and having trouble calming down. I think one thing is just a matter of discipline, even if it means I'll be late, I need to stop and get away from people and get myself in a better frame of mind, every time. 5-10 minutes late isn't great but it's not the end of the world. \n\nAll suggestions are welcome, I've gotten some great guidance from this group.",

Some random woman on her way to stand in line stops to shout loudly at this family about how inconsiderate they are about saving seats for their bags, and how it shouldn’t need to be said. Honestly it caught all of us off guard, AND my flights gate had changed at the last minute, so most people were standing to wait to line up for loading. This woman hadn’t asked to sit down and been denied, nor had anyone else. The men of the group were trying to tell her that someone had gotten up to go to the bathroom and she snapped back and darted off to the front of the line. They started talking to each other and I overheard that they were part of a chaperoning team who were with a group of 20 teenagers that I could see huddled in the corner, and their flight home had already been delayed for 3 hours. The lady that yelled, got out of line to circle back around and yell again about how they were being inconsiderate to the passengers that were currently boarding.\n\nI was getting irritated at this lady’s sense of entitlement, and it dawned on me- this used to be me. I used to be that person making a scene when someone cut in line or took up extra space in a public place, or even parked badly.

    "selftext": "This is an update regarding my recent anger outburst. I’ve booked a therapist and all of that but ever since that day where I basically massacred the family bedroom my anger has been starting to boil. You know those temptations where it makes you want to just destroy something? Such as punching a door, punching a hole through glass etc. \n\nWell just a few moments ago I had an argument with my father regarding my anger and what happened that day. When I mentioned my mother said that I’m just like him he didn’t take it that well and started to berate me on my actions those days ago. Even though I apologized after coming back home he still berated me for that. It wasn’t until I had to take something to the basement where I saw the punching bag. Thinking that I can just focus my frustrations on that I decided to have a few rounds at it. The next thing I remember is my father storming to the basement and getting all in my face asking if I’d bring the entire house down and that I want to be just like him. He then proceeded to push me which caused me to fall onto a wooden desk that has a pointy end which hurt the back of my head.\n\nAs soon as I noticed the blood I just looked at him with shock that he just shoved me and caused blood to come out  I felt and heard something snap. I don’t like being touched aggressively and that includes pushing me especially when blood is involved. I just lost it, all I remember is charging at him and hitting him until luckily my mother noticed the commission and saw me batter him and forced me off of him. Before I could even explain my mother yelled “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, LOOK WHAT YOU’VE DONE TO HIM! HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING!?” the last thing I saw before leaving the house was my mother helping my father up who now has a bloody nose and a few scuffs on his face, after that I got out of the house and immediately called my therapist saying to move the appointment to tomorrow. \n\nObviously I’m not welcome back to my home for now since I basically lost it on my father for pushing me and causing me to bleed for just letting my frustrations out on the punching bag. Due to me being above 18 years of age I’m worried that my parents will press charges on me since I gave him a bloody nose. But this is the 2nd instance where I had an angry moment within one week.\n\nIt’s all my fault, well mostly my fathers and myself since I basically took influence from him when it comes to getting the anger out either by punching a wall and all of that and myself watching those “Psycho Dad” videos made by that Mcjuggernuggets guy which gave me more bad ideas on getting my anger out. What else should I do? How can I get through this? How do I come back to my parents and apologize for beating up my very own father? What do I do if they decide to press charges on me for what I just did? So many questions are running through my head. I didn’t even mean all of this to happen! I fee so regretful right now. I let my emotions get to me, I snapped at my very own flesh and blood... \n\nI feel like you guys are the only people that understands what I’m going through since we all have some form of anger issues. I really need your advice on what to do next. I’m afraid on what to face after what happened...",

Later in life I was diagnosed with chronic depression, and now in a few years of treatment it's finally gone. I have appetite again, but most importantly, I finally can get angry.\n\nAnd it's like something uncontrollable and unstoppable got unleashed. Now in the same situations when I used to loathe myself, I start getting angry. Not at myself, mind you, the direction of my feelings has changed. It's anger at the world, at life, and just generally at everything that hurts me or fails or doesn't go my way, and it flares up at any minor opportunity! Even when it's completely stupid to get angry. Like, I keep failing a test and I become so worked up about it that I lose an ability to do anything, let alone proceed with the test. Anger is all-consuming, it's eating me alive. I even hurt myself and make myself bleed trying to work it out by hitting the table as hard as possible with the back of my hand, but it never really helps.\n\nThat's the problem with anger: it just won't stop, it can never be satisfied, and I know of no way to work it out! No matter what I do, like hit things or cuss, anger won't stop. It's so excruciating, it's a horrible feeling: you NEED to work it out somehow, yet you CAN'T!! The only way to deal with it I've found is to get distracted, but once I'm back in the same situation it started in, or just merely get reminded of it, it's back full-force. So that ultimately isn't helpful AT ALL in most cases, because if I got angry while, say, doing a test, then even if I've calmed down, going back to the test immediately makes me feel angry again. It's like the initial anger issue was not resolved, so it's back with no changes. It hampers my productivity because I just can't go back to the test in this example.\n\nP.S At this point I start to believe that depression was better. I still have semi-depressive thoughts and think of myself as a piece of shit, but now in addition to that I have anger feelings which make me unable to focus on stuff until I manage to distract myself (which takes a very long time, sometimes hours), and sometimes even that won't ultimately help.

    "selftext": "Ever since I’d experienced rage whilst meditating at a meditation course I talked about anger more openly to other people some family members and I tell it to whomever I think have a tendency to intrude in ‘my personal life online’,  for instance those involved in reading my e-mails and sending those e-mails to my parents (this has happened before a few years ago). I tell them details of what went through my mind when I’m angry how I wanted to obliterate everything in my line of sight, set it all on fire. \n\nBecause some people just don’t understand that anger can be addictive and rage can be overwhelming worse. Rage is like feeling my entire body is covered with energy, every single spot is filled with this same force. I felt pain to the point I had cried over this feeling but rage is power. I felt indestructible becoming an entity that’s sole purpose is to eradicate every single person who is involved in making my life worse than it should be as I see it. This feeling is so addictive, I guess I got addicted this anger and rage over the years because when I’m angry or feel enraged I don’t care about anything and all my fears are gone. But this anger makes me regret my actions which is why I meditate to keep it on a leash for it to run its course without acting out on anger and causing other people/myself to feel miserable.\n\nI tell those I see as a threat of intruding and exposing my private life about some of the thoughts that went through my mind about enacting revenge and my sole life purpose would be to make those people pay for what they did. And then I said if it wasn’t for the meditation I would probably have done exactly one of those things. \n\n",

In my country there are big problems with laws and salaries ($ 400-600 per person per month). But at the same time, we spend huge sums on the construction of stadiums that will not pay off their value for another 5 centuries, while this money could go to the organization of production in the country, which would give jobs and salaries to people. But my anger in this post was kindled by people who live in the cities where the Fifa 2018 matches will be held. Instead of giving a warm welcome to guests from other countries, I see how my fellow citizens rob our guests and make money for prostitution. The robbery is that they rent you an apartment for a cost of 10 + times the usual cost of renting a home. So for example to rent an apartment with two rooms for a month is $ 350 + per month, and you rent them for $ 4000 + for ONE DAY. Think about it. And our girls, using the influx of tourists, divorce them for money, in exchange for sex.\n\nAll I wanted to say is that it's not pleasant for me to realize that my country will be associated not only with Putin, vodka with national creativity, but also with greedy and dissolute people.",

    "selftext": "This have been going on since I was 16 and it's ruining my life. \n\nBefore 16 I never really had this problem but it usually starts with we will all be joking having a good time and what not, but all of a sudden I feel disrespected?  Then I tend to get triggered and blank out and automatically be in black and white fight or flight mode where my only options in my head are to beat the shit out of this person, or not defend myself with words and say nothing and let it dwell on me for days to come and go insane (usually heavy regrets  after that I should of beat him up or next time I see him how im gonna beat him).\n\nThis has happend over years and I've tripped out at my friends when we're all joking having a good time, shooting the shit then all of a sudden when I hear a personal joke, and it seems always when there's more than 1 person saying it to me,  I freeze and just get triggered.  I mean after I freak out it seems my friends become extra nice to me and do not joke around.  These are not the type of friendships I want, and I can't live my life like this.\n\nThe most recent would be at soccer where I see somebody who I wouldn't call a friend but someone who I'm acquainted with and see weekly.  We talk and usually joke to one another, but I was infront of my friends this time and he kept jawwing.  Typically if it were 1 on 1 I would talk back and have friendly jokes with him.  Since I was infront on my close friends, I felt weak and seemed like I was un able to defend myself and felt like my friends thought I was weak because of this person jawwing at me and me not reacting or saying anything back.  Again,  I only had 2 options, so I threatened him and got in his face and he was shocked and couldnt believe it.  I knew he was joking and it was all a joke but something triggers me and I go from 0 to 100 just like that.  \n\nThis has also been happening at work where i'l meet someone,  start feeling comfortable and joking, then all of a sudden another co worker gets in on it, and I snap.  My co worker that I just got comfortable with will crack jokes at me while another co worker is watching and laughing.  This person doesn't even know me, and I can't have someone making a joke of me.  It really affects my thought process,  i'l have thoughts like \"I can't take that shit\" \"their making a joke of me\" and alot of negative stuff.  But in a 1 on 1 setting I am untrigged and kept with a clear mind and able to kid around and not become triggered.\n\nBottom line is that when 1 or more people are roasting me,  I cannot take it.  I'm triggered and unable to stay calm and only see those 2 options in my thought process in tunnel vision.\n\nThis problem has kept me from joining new sports team, going to parties and basically alot of social events where i'l meet people.\n\nDoes anybody have anything similar going on?  I realize I'm not the best writer,  if you have any questions about the situation I will awnser them as I I've tried to give the most detail I could.  ",

Hoping that writing this out for someone to read will help me in some way, and maybe I'll pick up some good advice along the way. \n\nFirst, a little about me. I have a pretty good job that I should be thankful for. My immediate family is nothing short of perfect, i couldn't ask for better. I have friends, and i lead what i believe is a reasonably good life. \n\nFor some reason that i will never understand, i have had this simmering anger inside me that i cannot make go away, let alone control, for as long as i can remember. It affects my sleep, in that i can't fall asleep before laying in bed for at least two hours. At its worst, it boils over into explosive and violent outbursts where i swear up and down that i temporarily become a completely different person. It's like i just sit there and watch while my body takes me on a fucking rampage and the only thing i can think about is how much i hate everything around me. Fortunately my anger has the decency to not express its violence on other people. My cat has triggered it a few times by biting me (playfully in her mind, im sure), but i can at least get away from her before doing anything I'd regret. I admit though that i truly am scared that my anger might one day come to express itself on someone else, and i can't even begin to imagine what that would make me feel. \n\nIt's up and down, sometimes feeling like depression, sometimes I'm almost freakishly happy, and then i explode. It's been this way since i was a kid, and it feels like it's been getting worse. I don't know what to do or how to control it. I know that i need help, therapy or medication or something might do me a world of good. Unfortunately, my job is the type that would likely see me removed if it came to light that i needed medication or had some kind of severe depression or anxiety. \n\nIm writing this after having one of the worst \"anger attacks\" I've had in a long time about an hour ago. I dont know what to do, or honestly what i hope to accomplish by posting this.

    "selftext": "My wife grew up in an abusive broken home, verbally abusive, neglectful, physically abusive. I've never called her a name, I've never raised my hand to her but 4 years ago, after we got married things started going down hill in my life. She retreated into her old coping mechanisms and in response I shut down. She started school shortly after our wedding. I quit my dead end soul crushing job without already having a job in place. Feeling useless and pathetic, I first tried escaping into Reddit and Minecraft. Not joining her in bed at night, even when I told her I'd be there in a few minutes. Not realizing she was in bed feeling lonely and crying. She absorbed herself into her studies and began shutting down her feelings for me because I was shutting down mine on her.   Things got better after graduation. I got a job in my field, but Massage Therapy takes time to generate a profit. Longer where I'm a guy. But she got pregnant. Something we had been trying for. By her own admission I was a great partner to her during her pregnancy and was there for her during the birth every step of the way.   That's where is started to get bad again. Really bad. Our son was born with a massive head. Something like 95th percentile on a 50th percentile body. Nothing wrong with him. Just a massive head that ripped her apart during forceps delivery. It didn't help that our son was always clinging to her, nursing in short bursts every half hour. Always on her, sleeping next to her. She had postpartum and separation anxiety really badly. Through all this I started to falter in my promises to be an excellent father and husband. I would get upset at her for always nursing him. I would get upset that she never put him down, I would get upset that he was always crying if I tried to take him away from her to hold him. I would get angry and frustrated that I couldn't get any sleep from all the crying.   I began to scare my wife. My anger at things she couldn't help, things that in my anger I couldn't see. Couldn't understand. I would get angry over the smallest things. Couldn't find the oven mitts, something was burning on the stove, couldn't get the kid to fall asleep at the time I wanted. For 8 months we couldn't have sex. She was in so much pain and I tried to avoid any physical contact with her because I didn't want to be spurned for wanting sex which I knew would hurt her. The first year of our son's life, I was making so little money at work (What? A Man massage therapist? I want a woman!) I had to resort to dumpster diving. It's so demoralizing to be crying in a dumpster because I can't find a goddamn head of lettuce to take home to make a salad for lunch. I just kept being angry. At my self and my uselessness. At the world for giving everyone around me everything easily while I couldn't even find food for my family.   \n\n\nEventually we were able to start having sex again. I learned to really enjoy warming her up. She enjoyed that part too. Eventually it stopped hurting to try having sex. I started taking our son for Thursdays so she could hang out with her friends and have a girls night every week. Things started improving within my family. But I still had outbursts of anger.   \n\n\nIn 2014, my wife would push the stroller with our son to meet me after work every nice day. We could talk and walk, she would sleep in bed with me, bringing the baby too but that was okay. we could talk. In 2015, I got him a bed of his own but she moved to sleep with him because he wasn't ready to night ween. No more night talks. He learned to walk but couldn't be controlled or expected to walk the half hour to work. So the walk and talks ended. Communication faltered and I started feeling alone and neglected. I began getting angry and lashing out at every little detail. She went out with friends for supper instead of waiting for me? Unacceptable. She wanted an extra night out with the girls? No that's supposed to be US time!   \n\n\nI turned into an Ogre. She started seeing me as an abuser and I can't deny it. I would lecture her, make her feel bad even though I never outright insulted her. I still made her feel stupid and unloved. I would lose my temper if our son was misbehaving.   \nRight before Halloween she dropped the bomb on me. Slowly. She had started noticing how much safer she felt with her friends and their boyfriends/husbands. How she was developing romantic feelings for a female best friend who was being such a better emotional support than I had been for a long time. She had fallen out of love with me and feared coming home to me, or me coming home from work. for years she had asked me to seek counseling for myself and for the both of us and in my stupid pride I denied her that request.  she even moved out for a week to stay with friends. \nI'm so scared. I haven't been angry in 2 months. All I feel is fear, sadness, selfloathing and just plain defeated. I've gotten in touch with a psychologist. I have been staying calm in all situations. I have been doing anything she asked of me but she has 4 years of resentment on the 2 months I've been a better person. Tonight there was a blizzard and she is trapped at a friends house with the baby and she's was desperately trying to apologize for not being able to make it home because she's afraid I'm mad at her for not being here. I feel like a monster, and I know that's what she sees me at. She's given me 9 months to convince her I can stay a better person but my heart aches for her every day. I miss her hugs, her kiss, her trust, her love. I want to be the man she married. I want to give my son a stable home.   \n\n\n\nI just want the story to be told. I fell into an angry pit and it's ruined the most precious thing in my life. The only thing that made me feel special. Now I am hanging on by a thread and I wouldn't wish this feeling of slow death of the heart on anybody. ",

Turns out I have ADHD, which causes emotional dysregulation and with the depressive episodes, the anger tends to be even more accentuated. It's the most intense feeling I get by far. My therapist told me, this is interesting because female depression patients tend to be more sad and devaluate themselves whereas male patients tend to get more angry towards their environment.\n\nSo if you have gotten multiple different, at time conflicting, diagnoses, especially personality disorders which contradict each other and you are female, you should try go to a specialist for females or something. My 2 therapists that I had in the last 6 years, never understood where the others got the idea of personality disorders, when I clearly had something completely different going on. Some psychologist even diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder once, when I never ever hurt myself or tried to end my life and have quite stable friendships (which is amazing taking my occasional outbursts into account, love my friends for that honestly). They made me fill out 15 questions or something and decided on that, lol.\n\nI take natural antidepressants since september '21 now and not only the depression itself but the anger issues got better too. Don't get me wrong, I'm still like a rabid chihuaua, when someone disrespects me openly or does something unfair, but the threshold for being absolutely insufferably angry is much higher.\n\nI just wanted to tell you, because it took way too long to get that figured out and I hope this helps someone with their issues.",

    "selftext": "Ever since I was a kid, i have learnt the hard way to interact with my mother as little as possible. The slightest thing may cause her to explode, where she will start screaming, shouting, making threats and frequently, actual violence. \n\nThe most common cause seems to be anything that causes a deviation from her ideal reality. E.G. A tissue that fell onto the floor or someone trying to talk to her while she is watching TV. Even something as simple as suggesting an alternative course of action can trigger an outburst that lasts for at least 15 minutes, because she believes her course of action is perfect and that we should just shut up and obey without question.\n\nEvery attempt to try to suggest that she discuss things calmly has failed. She simply starts screaming \"NO!!! CANNOT!!!\", insists that she has the \"right\" to shout as much as she likes and blames us for her anger. About an hour after her outburst, she usually goes straight back to normal like nothing has happened. She does not appear to consider the possibility that she might be in the wrong and has never expressed any remorse for her outbursts.\n\nE.G. Earlier, she called a locksmith to change the lock on one of our doors that had jammed. From the phone call, it sounded like the locksmith was busy and it would be some time before he was available. I suggested we call other locksmiths in the area to see if any others were available. This immediately triggered an outburst where she started screaming that I should just shut up and wait along with the usual stuff about how everything is our family's fault, how we are useless, etc.\n\nHer outbursts usually do not contain any useful information, but this time round **she mentioned that she simply could not resist the anger, that she felt like she was on fire, had to shout to let the anger out and that she would explode if she didn't shout it out**. She also told me sarcastically that she would not talk nicely to me and that I should change mothers if I wanted that.\n\nAbout an hour later, she seemed to have forgotten that she had been screaming at me and just walked into my room to randomly tell me that she had cancelled an order she had placed for a chair on a shopping website because she had changed her mind on the purchase. She acted like it was the most natural thing in the world to do after telling your child to change mothers. Her tone was that of someone just randomly chit chatting with her family...I was stunned by how inappropriate it was.\n\nStrangely, she is usually able to control herself if we are in public, but in private, she will immediately start throwing a tantrum if she gets triggered.\n\nHer words this time made me think that she has some kind of disorder. I tried googling and found \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" (IED). It sounds very similar but she is able to control herself in public. Is that normal for IED?\n\nAnyone have any advice or suggestions? Unfortunately, I cannot get her to attend counselling or see a doctor as she believes it is perfectly normal for her to throw tantrums like this on a regular basis.",

I told her that I always personally come to her room to ask her something instead of yelling, and then she told me that I’m selfish and only come to her to get food (which is kinda true). I don’t need anything more than a computer and food. I got very angry at that (because first of all it’s emotional manipulation, and secondly I always do any work she asks. Never say no - At best I would say that I’d do it after some time, but then would forget and would need to be reminded (aka shouted at). Still I always help as much as I can.\n\nIn the privacy of my room I became a psychopath. Hit the ipad so hard the screen cracked. Before this I’ve broken a bucket by kicking it angrily. I don’t deserve things. I ripped apart a Tshirt, made my room a mess, and punched my pillow hard. At this stage I was having thoughts about grabbing a knife and stabbing various things like the pillow, the mattress etc (luckily I’ve never done such a thing) and sometimes even think of stabbing myself in the chest, though these thoughts go away with the anger. I also screamed and yelled like a maniac, I don’t know what the neighbours would be thinking. I have always had a short temper but it’s getting worse and my environment is only making me more angry. I need help.",

    "selftext": "I've marked this as NSFW because I discuss cremation and I know it may be hard to read for some. Why do the people I love keep dropping like flies? Last year my dad took a heart attack and passed away. Three months ago my sister died of cancer. And now last week my granny and 23 year old auntie were killed in a car crash. It's not fair. It's not fucking fair. I have enough shit on plate already without having to lose more people I love. And she was my favourite auntie. I just feel mad now, and angry and pissed off. Like what the fuck did them, my dad or my sister do to have their lives cut short? I feel abandoned now and if God was real, which I don't think he is anyway, it feels like he hates me and wants me to suffer.\n\nI posted here a good few times about Heidi, another woman who I loved so much. I used to call her my \"auntie\" too because we were so close and then when my sister died Heidi \"kindly offered\" to give her a free cremation since she owns a funeral home, knowing my sister had a fear of fire and not even telling me until the funeral. I don't find cremation comforting and I hate it. No matter what I do with my sister's ashes, I hate it. I want to make it clear, I'm not against cremation for people who WANT TO be cremated. But this Heidi bitch only did it to my sister because it's what she wanted, and keeps saying it's so she can be \"close to my heart\" and keeps acting like she loves and cares about me and my sister. She's not close to me. She's just dust.\n\nAnd now my auntie is being cremated because her boyfriend, who only knew her for a few months and wasn't even that close to her wanted her to be. And now I have to go to the funeral and pretend to be thankful to the people who are going to turn her into something as ugly as they are. I hate the people who work at the crematorium, and Heidi might be cremating her. I don't know. I hate that they keep saying how their job is so honourable because they give families \"peace and closure.\" I'm not denying they do for some people, but not everyone. I feel so angry at them. Maybe they have good intentions but I don't give a shit. What the hell do I do now? The way they act is another slap in the face and I still feel like I'm the villain for being angry at the \"poor people who dedicate their life's work to helping others.\" I don't find comfort in cremation and I'm NOT thankful to them.\n\nPlease, can I just be mad at them? I talked to people on the funeral directors sub who treated me like shit and told me my anger isn't valid at all. Heidi's colleague sent me an email which seemed nice but was just trying to convince me to tell Heidi \"Thank you for taking care of my sister\" when she could at least acknowledge that maybe she doesn't help everyone. They act like I owe them something. I'm somehow the bad guy because Heidi posted a picture of my sister's ashes on facebook about how it was heartbreaking to cremate her and how she took care of her with the \"utmost dignity\" and when I asked her to take it down I got crucified. The people who do cremations, from my experience are egotistical cunts who like to think they're helping everyone and if you dare say that you don't appreciate what they did then it's your own fault. It's okay to be angry at them and you don't owe them shit. If anyone needs to vent, I'm here to listen.",
