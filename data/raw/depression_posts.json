All it does is feed people ammo they so boldly crave to put us down even more while propping up their own status in front of their peers they're so desperately trying to impress. All being ugly does is get me judged for my cover as is my race already takes care of. I can't change my race, I can't change my height and yes you may be able to change an ugly face with *methods* but that is unattainable and I don't want to do that. I want society to stop being so lookist for no reason. Unfortunately that will never happen. I don't know why it's so difficult. When I see an ugly person I am not repelled. \n\nYou could be the most unattractive person and if you me feel welcome and are very respectful it would mean the world to me. I wish I could feel at ease with relatable people but sometimes even they themselves are lookist. On the opposite side of the scale I have met some very pleasant attractive people, and not all of them are stuck up or have egos. The world is not black and white obviously but it is very frustrating that lookism runs so rampant in public. \n\nAlot of people are unfortunately not home-trained to grow up with the manners and basic courtesy we are suppose to have in public. The world is very ingrained in the attitude of \"I got mine so f*** you!\" and I'm so tired of it. Going out in public puts this in full display. No one wants to treat anyone with respect anymore. Everything is for vanity. It's all competition. I'm not saying you gotta love everybody but can we just get some more respect and courtesy in society. The ones who want to keep out of the negativity and away from others are made out to be lame and such. \n\nEverything out is always a battle. The good some of us do does not matter when we lack the advantages others got lucked into being born with. Who am I kidding we'll only be made fun of for being nice anyway? People sometimes make me feel worse for the way I was born like. When I do not want to be around people for these very reasons I am an outlier and villianzed for not wanting to partake in this destructive game. I always feel hated anyway, there was never a time in my life when I haven't. When a kid grows up being stressed almost every single time period of their lives it's no wonder they don't want to partake in society or be around other people. \n\nI grew with so so many disadvantages I feel like the only thing I can do is isolate and even that is not enough. I cannot wait until this is over. Every so often I get a change of thought and think maybe it's no so bad but then something ropes me into thinking otherwise again. Nothing feels fair and I don't really want to live it out to continue suffering from plenty more decades.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone. So I (40s m) had a mental breakdown a few months ago. And I came to the realization that I've been depressed and apparently I've been for the majority of my life. Now that I've acknowledged that I'm depressed it seems that I get depressed more often and I don't know what to do. I'm typing this at 4am so I apologize if this is all over the place. \n\nSo I lost my job mid last year and it's been a pain in the ass to get a new one. I've applied in god knows how many jobs in my field with no luck. I live with my mom and she's been pretty supportive with this whole unemployment thing but it weighs pretty heavy on me. I was/have been trying to stay positive and not let it get me down but its hard. I kept thinking  \"I can make it one more day, just make it through the day and I'll be fine\". I've always had self-esteem/confidence/self-worth  issues but I thought I had gotten over it(well most of it as an adult would get). Sometimes I would get those voices of self doubt in my head but I could mostly ignore those and when I couldn't I would get over it in a few days and go back to the normal grind. But it all came to a head around Fall. I was driving around running errands and was heading back home when I got the idea to grab some food(it was mid morning/early afternoon). But I realized I couldn't afford it and that's when the self doubt voices started back up. And to be honest I really tried to fight them off. I was telling myself \"You're ok, you're ok.\" but I was at the point where I just couldn't fight  the self doubt and I knew I was losing the fight and all of a sudden I told myself \"Dude you are NOT ok\" and the second I said that I started crying and I legit couldn't stop. I legit got into a debate with myself if I should talk to someone or not. Just out of fear of looking weak. I had to tell myself that I'm fortunate enough to have a solid support system and it would be stupid NOT to use it. So I wiped my  tears  off and hauled ass home. I took a minute in the driveway to get myself together(I didn't want to scare my mom) and went inside to so when I got in I asked her could we talk for a minute. She asked if I was ok and I immediately lied and said I was. The minute I said that I was fighting back tears again and I told her the truth that I wasn't ok and just emotionally dumped on her. I told her how I've been feeling and she said she figured I wasn't feeling too hot because I wasn't doing my usual hobbies(If you cant tell by my name I play fighting games) I would play for maybe an hour and then just go upstairs and sleep. She was super supportive and helped me get a therapist and they've been a little bit of help but not as much as I would've hoped.  There's even more going on but I'm tired and don't want to type out damned term paper for you guys to go through.\n\nSo now that I've acknowledged and accepted that I have depression  it seems like I get depressed more often. I'm not sure what to do or how to navigate this whole thing. It almost feels like I've opened Pandora's box and I feel I did better when I was just \"powering through it\".  I know logically that it's not the case and it's much better to face it head on but I'm navigating unknown waters. Is this normal? Thanks a bunch everyone",

Nobody can understand me, so I don’t have anyone to talk to about what’s happening to me, and if I do it then I start to weight the people I love, I’m sorry about that. So now I’m a little lonely, I always cry alone now, not even my best friend who is doing therapy knows how to help me. I have to endure my whole life even if right now my arms are weak. I’m always afraid of taking a false step and ruining everything... I would like to find comfort in someone, but I can’t tell these things to anyone, I would like to have something that gives me relief, but I don’t want temporary relief with permanent consequences. My mother doesn’t want me to see a psychologist/psychiatrist, so I’ll go to the clinic on my own secretly to do an introductory interview with a social worker. But secrets sooner or later come to the surface, I’m afraid that when she finds out she’ll get angry with me and take away from me the parish and the church, the things that make me happy. I feel too small to be able to handle all this on my own. People are only interested in feeling helpfull, not being. Yesterday a friend asked me if everything was going well, I answered him not really, for the first time I was honest, I wanted him to comfort me, maybe he didn’t hear or didn’t want to listen, he changed the topic of the conversation. Another friend of mine, who is the one to whom I’ve been telling everything for more than a year, told me that if my mother thinks like that then there’s no point, I think he gave up on me.. my friend who is a psychologist practically said that I can’t vent ti her, I need to start therapy, but how do I do if I don’t have the means, if my path is full of obstacles? It’s as if everything depends on me, it’s like I’m always the only one who makes mistakes. Another friend told me about the fact that I have to talk better about it with my mother, but I tried several times and I was brave, she forbade me to go to a psychologist/psychiatrist and so now I have to hide my pain, otherwise she will take away the things I love. Maybe people forget that I’m sick, that I’m the one who’s sick, that I’m the one who lives this pain in first person, they expect me to be able, to be capable, to find a solution to a problem that is unsolvable in my eyes. I try to be strong for myself and others, but I wonder, until when? I smile and I am of comfort for those in need, for those who are younger than me. It bothers me to ruin all the academic achievements I’ve accumulated over the years, but I think this is my breaking point. Maybe my life is too painful, it’s sad that I don’t know how to grasp the beauty when it’s in everything around me, maybe I’m just wasting resources that shoulg ho to someone else. I don’t want to hurt others, I want to see what beautiful things life still has to offer me, however, do I really have to suffer so much before feeling happy? Do I really have to endure such pain before I can smile? Is that really all that awaits me? The decision is only in my hands now, I realized that not even “adults” know how to manage certain situations, but I don’t blame them, my misfortune is that I was the protagonist of a bad nightmare when I was not ready yet to see such strong images. I was a strong and sunny girl, determined and ambitious, I remember the tears but also the smiles. There will be some days when I won’t be able to smile anymore, but I ask that the days when I did to be remembered. I loved my life, but I suffered too much.\n(Don’t worry, I won’t do impulsive actions, I just wan’t some comfort)",

Yes I understand I have been given all of the tools to succeed in life yet I feel empty. Maybe this is coming off as arrogant bc I live in a first world country. That is not my intention. I just need advice and I don’t know where to get it from, so I turn to you Reddit, where some would think you would get the least amount of helpful advice I have found that Reddit is where you come to find truly helpful advice, advice where you sit and think “wow this has changed my life in a meaningful way.” I don’t want pity I just want help, I had suicidal thoughts in the past but in past that. I just want to be happy.",

    "selftext": "I had a great shift, I did. I work in a great setting, with cool creative enthusiastic people. My best friend of ten years is my colleague. What could be better? \nI have a few great guys that are into me and try to get closer. Genuinely good men. \n\nI’m sex repulsed at the moment so it just serves me as an ego boost which could be a nice thing. I act as if it was.\n\nBut the only thing I can think of once I get home is what of a relief it would be to just stop existing. To do the same as my partner did. To just kill myself. \n\nAt this point, it is a very plausible outcome, I just wait and see. If my life reaches a point i can’t willingly partake in anymore, my solution is all ready in my mind. I know exactly how I would do it. \n\nBut people have always told me that I have so much potential, that I’m so smart, wise, and that I will have a great impact on the world. That I’m pretty and have a healing energy to me. That people trust me and love me. \n\nThen why the person I was planning to spend my life with killed themself? Why do I have to struggle to stay focused? Why has everything always been  hard? I feel like a fighter. A lonely fighter who has no reason to fight anymore. I’m just there, fighting while it’s doable, just in case something fun happens. Life keeps deceiving me regardless of how hard I try. Being sexually abused as a kid, then again as a teen, being raised in poverty with a narcissistic mom, being groomed which actually helped me live a somewhat decent life, sold drugs for my mom, lived in a foster house, then ending up doing escorting work as a mean to help myself and my family, and now my beloved partner killing himself? Why do I have to be gods strongest fighter. (Obviously a ref to the meme, I don’t believe in god and if I did I would just hate him so much.) \n\nI feel like a puppet. A smiling, fun to be around, pretty, put together, desirable, little puppet. Hehe I have nothing to loose so why not pretend I’m what people would like me to be. The funny, mysterious and sexy girl? Yeah I can be that for you. Sure. \n\nYou look happy, you seem to be so much better! Oh thanks, I just accepted that I’m dead inside. My little secret to success (yay). \n\nI always keep in mind that if it becomes too hard, my escape is right there. Pills, bridge, od. \n\nAnd why the fuck have I received the most compliments in my whole life during the last few months which have clearly been the saddest, most unhealthy and soul wreaking months of my existence? I have even received more compliments then when I was an overly sexualized teen. Crazy. People are so twisted. The savior complex in not a myth. I can save her! Fuck you weirdo!\n\nJust an early morning suicidal vent. Thanks for reading. We’ll see how it turns out. ",

And that self love was the greatest love of all.\n\nI rolled my eyes internally so hard. Platitudes and cliches? That's what my therapist was feeding me?\n\nI ranted to my friend about it, and while he thought she was an idiot, he was not so sure she was wrong.\n\nI clearly don't respect her. But I respected him enough to give it some thought.\n\nThe fact that I couldn't tell the difference between self love and self esteem is actually really telling.\n\nI think I've learned to conflate love and pride, because while I desperately wanted love from my father, he constantly had me up against a measuring stick.\n\nValuing things about myself is conditional. Caring about myself is not.\n\nI realize now that she meant love as in to care about myself. To assert to myself that I'm worth the time it takes to maintain myself.

Last night, when I saw that I failed an exam, my suicidal thoughts peaked. I just collapsed on the floor, thinking I’m a complete failure. In the past two years, I’ve already failed two courses. Why? I feel like I worked so hard for this exam—what more can I do? Maybe I should just end it. I thought about jumping off a building.\n\nBut I’m scared. If I survive, I could end up disabled, stuck living here—and that would be even worse than dying.\n\nI’m trying to figure out why I’ve become like this:\n\n\t1.\tMy relationship with my family is bad.\nMy parents divorced when I was 10. I was placed under my father’s custody, but even though he was my legal guardian, he didn’t really care for me. My grandparents were the ones who raised me. My family doesn’t care much about how I feel; their only concern is my academic performance. My dad makes me get up at 8:00 AM every day to study, and if I oversleep, he yells at me. Because of this, I’ve grown distant from my family. The only person in my family who somewhat understands me is my mom, but because we live far apart, I only see her once a year.\n\t2.\tI don’t have a friend I can talk to about my feelings or worries.\nSometimes, I desperately want someone to share my thoughts and feelings with. But I think nobody really cares about me, and if I open up, I’ll just make them worry. Besides, even if a friend comforts me, it won’t solve anything—I’ll still feel miserable. So, I stay quiet.\n\t3.\tI’m living in a place where being LGBTQ is seen as abnormal.\nPeople always assume I’m straight, but I’m not. Still, I have to pretend to be, because I’m scared. I once came out to my mom over the phone. She was surprised and told me that Karl Lagerfeld (the former creative director of Chanel) was gay. I said, “Mom, so am I.” She refused to believe me and said, “Liking girls is just a phase. Being gay will bring you disrespect from others, and you’ll face so many difficulties if you choose this path.” I didn’t know how to respond—I just wanted to hang up the phone. I regretted coming out to her. She’s never brought it up again and still believes I’m straight. I don’t care what she thinks anymore. I’ve never come out to my friends because I’m afraid of how they’d react—some of them are openly homophobic.\n\t4.\tThe place where I live sucks.\nI think most people here have mental health issues, including my family, but they all believe that people with mental illnesses are abnormal. On top of that, seeking professional help is risky. Most therapists here aren’t qualified, and they might say things like, “You’re overthinking it—that’s why you’re depressed.”\nAs someone about to graduate, I can’t see a future for myself. I feel helpless, like I’m drifting in a river with nothing to hold onto.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I am writing this because I am in a lot of pain at the moment. It's the exam season now and I was supposed to be stuying as I truly am a good student, but everything is also very depressing at the moment. In december I met a really nice guy, who took great care of me. I was with him all the time (except when I was at uni or working) and we spent a lot of time together. He cared for me in ways nobody else did before. I am not gonna text everything that he has done but it really seemed that he cared about me. He cared so much about me that it was too much for me at that time, because I was really busy with studies, work and I also had many problems at home (fam stuff) so I pushed him away and left. But now that I am better with everything (I was completely burnt out at the end of december) I texted him, saying that I am sorry for the way that I treated him and if  I could take it all back, I really would, because he truly cared about me. And I actually riped my heart out in this messages and his response was really mean and I can't sleep nor eat because of it. He told me that, it was fun while it lasted (our thing) and that he wanted to break up anyway that he just used my situation as a excuse for ending it all. But we would not even end us if I wouldn't leave that night when I was really tired and then decided to sleep at home. Now he just completely changed and I get it that his ego was bruised back then, but I really can not understand why the hell he would be so mean, when I was really really sincere and wanted to make things right now, when I explained how depressed I actually was when we had a thing and I wanted to let him know that I left because I didn't want him to have me when I was so broken. But now he acts like we had nothing and that he wanted to end everything even tho that night that I left he made room in his place for me to bring my things and treated me like we were a couple. Im sorry for a long message, I really can't sleep and I hope somebody can say something to me to calm down because I have so much stuff to do but I also am hurting a lot a the moment.\nThank you for reading.

    "selftext": "A rant/vent maybe, IDK. So I just got done being the best version of myself I could ever be. I took an extended break from what I was doing and when I came back I just couldn’t coordinate. I rage quit what I was doing, knowing exactly what would happen afterward and I still did it. I’ve resorted to self-isolation for the past 4 months and for some reason want to keep it that way until I no longer wake up the next morning. It’s always been this way just kind of playing with the game of life but on this occasion I genuinely damaged all self sense of identity and reputation. I accidentally involved my family in this although that’s always a given (can never run away from them). I stopped taking care of myself as well just sitting on my phone all day. I continue to be lost as the person who helped me reach this point once said who I wish I could have back. I betrayed this person, I did exactly what they advised not to do again kind of knowing exactly what would happen. It’s like I enjoy being in a, “what if state”. I don’t want to walk around gloriously trying to be positive or telling those around me that, “I’m going to be this now”, or “I’m going to be that”. It’s like I enjoy causing pain because I don’t really enjoy being loving and caring although I MISS it so much. 21 year old M who betrayed a very grown mature young 30 yr old boss who I said so many good things about my future too. Everyone on my team said it would be okay but I don’t listen don’t speak up. Fell in love with someone I shouldn’t/have never truly had a girlfriend cause I’ve never wanted to humiliate myself begging for their attention give that’s one of the many ways to keep ‘em.",

    "selftext": "I was in university for 3 years and felt majorly depressed being there alone in a city with no friends other than my fiancé staying an hour away from me. I had to work to support myself barely being able to even come to my classes because I couldn’t afford rent and had to work. I had so many nights where I drank myself to throwing up and went to visit bridges and tall car parks just to imagine what it would feel like. It was a really dark time for me but I pushed through it because i wanted to be there for my fiancé  and I always had it in the back of my mind that I needed to graduate and push forward so that I could get a job and start my real life with her and hopefully find myself more.  \nI graduated over a year ago and I was so proud of myself for getting a good grade because I knew how hard those 3 years had been on me and for a few months I genuinely felt like things were looking better for me. \n\nAfter graduating I came to realise that my degree in Computer Science has pretty much become useless in this job market and my dreams of software engineering had pretty much completely shattered after applying to well over 500 software engineering jobs over the space of a few months only managing to secure 1 interview which rejected me. They all tell me it’s because they found another candidate with experience but I can’t get any experience without getting a job, I’ve applied to internships volunteer work in my field to receive nothing. I’ve had professionals look over my CV to tell me that it’s perfect and that nothing should change. I decided to lower my job search to any tech job whatsoever so I can secure some sort of tech experience ones you don’t even need degrees for and same thing over 400 applications 1 interview and rejected.\nI managed to secure a basic delivery job which I didn’t like because I had been hoping to work in the tech field out of university but accepted it as in my mind it was temporary until I find my tech job.\n\nI was feeling quite low but was pushing forward until I found out that my fiancé had been cheating on me. It completely destroyed me. \nShe was a major reason for me to keep pushing. I couldn’t believe that she actually did that to me. I gave her years of my life and was genuinely faithful and was working to provide a life for her and it ripped me apart to come to the realisation that everything with her was a facade. It was so confusing to me because she  always seemed so genuine to me it was a major shock to me and I was deeply in love with her and thought she had the same feelings for me. \nI came to find out she had pretty much been cheating on me for majority of our relationship and I had no idea until a day she bought a new phone and she gave me her old one to sell for her and I randomly decided to snoop out of boredom which I never did before. I couldn’t believe what I had seen on it it was like I was looking at the phone of a person completely different to who I had thought I was with. I confronted her and she pretty much just apologised and admitted she was cheating on me without batting an eye as if she hadn’t just shattered me completely I couldn’t believe that what wad happening was real.\nI ended things with her and fell into deep sadness and ended up losing my job because of the fact that I couldn’t sleep properly for weeks after this and ended up oversleeping and coming in late a few times and they let me go without a question.\nMy separated parents both were also made redundant and lost their jobs and were already dealing with deep depression too I have no family that I can go to talk to about my problems because they are already dealing with enough. \nMy car broke down and I already could barely afford to fix it unemployed as it needed a whole new engine and I just about managed to cover it just for it the new engine to fail on me the next day after fixing it and I now don’t have the money to do anything with it.\nMy debts are stacking up from my bills and everyday I apply to every type of job I see for months and not even a part time job wants me.\nMy only friend I had left owed me a bit of money which was the last of what I had to my name at this point which I gave to him to help him with his own situation he was drowning in previously and to my luck as he was coming to return it to me he was pulled over and arrested with drugs in his car with the police confiscating the last of my money as evidence for the supply of drugs. He is now being sentenced to 4 years in jail … I have literally have nobody and the worst thing is everyone around me is dealing with very difficult situations so I want to help them but I’m also drowning.\n\nI don’t understand I feel like I’ve been stripped of every single thing in my life I had going for me I don’t get it. I already had been dealing with deep sadness over the years but these last 4-5 months have completely ripped me apart to the point I don’t even feel sad anymore I don’t feel anything. This life doesn’t feel real anymore it feels like a sick joke there’s not an ounce of happiness anywhere around me no one I care about is happy or stable and I live in a ghetto shit hole full of drug addicts that I have to see everyday I just want to run away but I can’t even afford that at this point. Everyday I wake up and do pretty much nothing because there is nothing to do but apply to jobs that end up rejecting me anyway.\n\nI kind of just needed a place to get my thoughts out because I have no one to talk to and I’ve never felt so worthless in my life I feel suicidal but I’m religious so in my beliefs people that commit suicide go to hell so this life feels like a prison to me that I have to just sit and ride my sentence for. As well I’ve pretty much lost touch with my religion too because of my depression which furthers my depression I’ve been sober for 4-5 days now because I can’t do it to myself I’ve destroyed myself recently with the drugs and drinking and it can’t continue but I don’t feel better I just feel like I’m taking my issues more head on these last few days but I just hope that it helps me long term if I can keep it up because something has to change.\n\nIdk what I’m doing but the days have been merging into weeks and weeks into months and I feel like I’m waiting for nothing now. I know people deal with some pretty dark things there are people dealing with worse everyday I’m grateful to be able to just about have a roof over my head and food on my table but is that really all there is to life?",

    "selftext": "I have run out of energy for now, I am done trying and all I want to do is lay in my bed and sleep. Ive been a caregiver for my mom for two years because she had breast cancer. Luckily her cancer is in remission and she’s making steps to move out in June but I don’t know if I can wait that long anymore. She expects me to help her with every menial task everyday. She needs help reaching things because she can’t bend over. She needs help going through mountains of boxes and moving them into her storage unit because she is a hoarder. She is extremely difficult to work with when it comes to cleaning the house and decluttering her things. I don’t even have the energy to cook anymore because the cupboards are packed full of stuff. She makes rude back handed comments to me everyday and I have grown resentment towards her ever since I started caregiving because I shouldn’t of been the one to take care of her. She cries everyday over her situation and I have run out of sorrys to give her. She hates everyone in this family and has isolated herself from them. She doesn’t have anymore friends. She is divorced yet her ex husband is the only person that comes to help her. I don’t like him because he is also toxic and unhealthy. My mom complains about being overweight, complains about not feeling good but doesn’t make effort to do a small workout or even go outside for a walk. I’m tired of worrying about her, her health, her happiness. I am so tired. I wish I could phase out of existence. If I told her to move out now I would get some peace but she would still have to come over to get her hoard, and she would be so angry at me and wouldn’t let me hear the end of it. The only option I have is somehow surviving 5 more months of bickering, nitpicking, back handed comments. 5 more months of outrageous stress, masking, depression, anxiety. Maybe today is just a bad day. I’ve been getting worse, I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. If I just killed myself she wouldn’t have to move her hoard she could just keep my house. That would make it so much easier for her. I feel like I am on the brink of psychosis.\n\nEdit: earlier today my mom knew I was upset and forced it out of me even though I kept saying I’m scared to talk to her about my feelings because she always says I’m triggered or too sensitive. Well I told her how stressed out and overwhelmed I am with everything and I didn’t like the backhanded comment she made today and my mom said I have it really good, I have it a lot better than she does. Is that supposed to make me feel better? I thought a mother is supposed to console their child not guilt trip them.",

    "title": "How to feel stuff again?",
    "selftext": "(Disclaimer: Mentions of self harm)\n\nI think through watching gore and stuff throughout my teens and also starting to listen to much heavier and sadder music as I grew up has really messed with my brain along with many other things. It’s like I’m desensitised to feeling anything. I have to force myself to be happy but if I wanted to at any moment I could pull a complete blank face and snap out of it. I think that’s why I find social interaction so tiring, it’s a constant performance. Also I have to force myself to cry and let emotion out but at any moment even when in complete tears I can just snap out of it and pull a straight emotionless face. I have to choose to cry.\n\nI also used to listen to very basic music but my music taste has evolved a lot. For some reason I pretty much exclusively listen to agonisingly sad music. I think it used to be a defence mechanism, the cathartic feeling I got felt so good. I like to romanticise my sorrow. But I listen to sad music all the time, even if I’m happy or just going about my day and showering or cooking I usually only listen to sad music. I literally got to the point where it started to sound happy to me. I’d listen to super sad Elliott Smith and Alex G songs and feel ‘happy’ but I think my brain had just been completely ruined by depression so I felt like catharsis and painful nostalgia was happiness. I’d play other people the songs and they’d be like “wtf this is really depressing” and it would catch me off guard and I’d feel really confused and be in my head like “that’s weird it doesn’t sound that sad to me??”. I also got put onto Screamo music and DSBM (Depressive Suicidal Black Metal) which again probably numbed me to my emotions a lot as music that I used to find unbearable and way too intense I now listened to all the time. I love sad and heavy music more than anything but I think it’s really messed with my mental health and the way I feel my emotions. I genuinely feel grossed out when I listen to most happy music. I enjoy upbeat Funk sometimes but I feel like vomiting if I listen to anything too happy.\n\nWhen it comes to gore, when I was younger it would terrify me and I would cover my eyes but I felt curious afterwards and eventually started exposing myself to more and more stuff. I’d then be not fully comfortable watching super graphic gore so I could watch someone get shot on a bodycam vid or something and not be too freaked out but eventually I’d accidentally come across something way more graphic that I wasn’t expecting which would I guess somewhat desensitise me more without me actually having a choice which would slowly lead to me watching more and more graphic videos over time. It got to the point where anytime I sat down to eat a meal I’d just naturally put on a horrible video about some awful murder that happened because it’s all I was entertained by. Other videos I found really boring and I was too depressed to focus on any actually intelligent or well made videos. But I didn’t think at any point while I was doing this that it might be affecting my mental health. I have suddenly realised how destructive up a lot of my habits were but I feel terrified by the fact that I was completely unaware of it while it was happening. Now I’m aware of it but I still find it very hard to feel emotions in the same way I used to when I was younger.\n\nThe biggest thing that worries me is my desensitisation to self harming. I went through a bad spot and I cut myself and really didn’t feel very much about it. I even took pictures of myself (not to show anyone, I don’t really know why I took them, I had accidentally gone cold turkey off of anti-depressants and wasn’t in a normal state of mind at all.) But yeah I have to force myself to feel like things are as bad as they actually are. Maybe because I don’t want to come to terms with the fact that I cut myself and that I was in such a bad place. Like I’m traumatised by my own mental health and would rather just disassociate. But yeah it’s very scary because when I was younger even the thought of someone else self harming let alone seeing an image of it would make me feel physically sick and there is no way I would have ever done it, I even thought it was weird and nonsensical to do it. But now I have done it and my brain doesn’t feel any survival instincts anymore. I think I’ve fucked my brain by cutting myself and can no longer feel emotions in the right way.\n\nPlease, any advice would be massively appreciated.",

I got very overwhelmed because my schedule was so packed that i have no time for myself and basically 6 hours of sleep everyday. I started thinking about my future and got really anxious as i was questioning my own decisions. I wasn't happy with my job. I was suffering in my relationship and tried my best to work things out but we still broke up. The reason he gave me was that he had \"lost interest\". Both my mental and physical health couldn't stand the pressure and broke down. My depressive symptoms returned. I had to give my job up and reconsider my choices. \n\nI actively searched for help and tried my best to prioritize my own mental health. I started to understand my trauma and how it shaped my personality through weekly therapy. Although it was tough dealing with a relapse, I tried to tell myself that I can manage it since I did it once before. \n\nJust as things went well, I had a big fight with my parents. It was so bad because it triggered my past trauma and I ended up with a panic attack, my whole body was then frozen because I was hyperventilating uncontrollably. This incident tore me up. My whole world turned grey after that. I felt so disappointed in everything and thought that there was no point of living. It was the lowest I had been in my whole life. I stopped showing up for checkups and therapy. I stopped my medication. I cut off all of my communication with my friends. I just stopped looking at texts. \n\nI had many breakdowns and wanted to take my life but my mom stopped me. I gradually got numb after that but I still hate myself so much that I couldn't look into the mirror without feeling disgusted. I just stared at the screen day and night doing nothing else so that my brain wouldn't have time to think.\n\nI had to completely tire myself out until I can fall asleep the second I hit the bed or else I would start thinking of ways to kill myself again while trying to fall asleep. I spent 3 months living like this until now. Last week I actually found the perfect way to kill myself and prepared everything I needed for it. I started writing the last letter that I would leave for the world. I started spending my money on things that I wanted but didn't because it wasn't necessary. \n\nI thought it wouldn't be hard for me to do it. I just have to drink it. It is the easiest way and the best plan I could come up of. But that sleepless morning I looked outside the window listening to a piano melody and brokedown again. It was long since the last one. I thought my heart was already numb. But i was terrified, I felt the loneliest I have ever been, I cried my heart out. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but I couldn't find the point of living. I was so out of shape that I feel like it would take an unimaginable huge amount of effort to rebuild myself. I don't think that I can do it. It's draining me by just having the idea of it. I'm stuck. I'm currently stuck here.",

I feel depressed, I am so utterly alone even around my family, I find me talking to myself every chance I get just to hate on the things I have done and to remind myself all of the regrets I have accumulated in the past 20 years of my life. Recently I got into an accident bc of it and it was the first time i opened up to my family about how I felt so disgusting and low and how I will truly never achieve anything in life. I didnt mention everything but i cried alot after. I had thought about self harm from little but I never acted on it, and a couple times recently i wished to die, but the thought of hell makes me feel so sick. I feel like i am suffocating, truly. I cant breathe thinking I might burn for the rest of eternity. I cant breathe thinking about how i will be alone, and engulfed in this darkness, and my skin will burn over and over and over and i hate it i wish i wasnt born. I wont accomplish anything in my life, i will never find that someone to spend the rest of my life with, i am miserable but the thought that it only gets worse is unimaginable to me. I love my god but i dont believe i will get into heaven bc i have only sinned, so so much, the same things over and over, and recently i have stopped trying. I hate the idea that in the grave, i could be awake and concious for it all, the walls of my coffin will squeeze so tight my ribcages will touch. I want to cry, i have a mental breakdown so much times per day, i drown myself in porn bc it calms my nerves when i think abt these things. Please, i am suffocating in this life, crushed by my thoughts and actions and regrets, i am so tired. My mom said I will regret it if i waste my youth and it kills me to know i have already wasted my life by being me, i have no friends, in the past month i left my house about 3 times, i want to get up and leave and walk around and do whatever, anything so im not alone with myself, but i think abt it, and there isnt anyone to go meet, or places to visit, i am rotting away even as i live through each day. Its my fault, never for a second have i not known this, i know im fucking pathetic, i could be doing something like everyone else is but i choose to be this piece of fucking trash. But i cant die, because i am so fucking scared to suffer eternally, my crying drowned out by my own screaming, burning, melting. This is the first time i have ever shared this much of myself with anyone, anywhere, it helps. ",

I surrounded myself with acquaintances and studies that i didn’t really think for myself or have any time for myself and i thought i was feeling better? However i now see i don’t think i ever left the depressive state. On christmas eve of 2024 I broke up with my friends of 4years, my mother and sister were both there for advice and assured me that it was a toxic friend group in which they used me to make themselves feel better. After that point i just went downhill, on christmas i was quite disheartened and out of it, my eating habits changed- i started eating less, i started losing focus in my classes therefore dropping grades and having meetings with my college. I started feeling bad about myself and sometimes i got very bipolar with people that are close to me. I’ve now got my AS-level mocks coming up and i just feel so useless and stupid.

Pretty sure The only people that would notice if I disappeared is my roommate because then they'd have to figure out how to cover rent, and my friend who would only miss my free labor whenever she asks if I can help her with something around her house. \n\nI'm 30 fucking years old and the longest relationship I've had has been 2 years. I've been ghosted and ignored so many times I don't even want to try anymore. Don't even know why, id show the message thread to some friends that are women and they all said they'd keep talking to me, no idea why they stopped. \n\nMy mom won't stop sending me \"Christian\" Instagram reels from obvious grifter accounts, claiming she's trying to help my soul. my dad thinks everything I've ever done is wrong. Even as a kid, nothing I've done was ever \"good.\" It was always either \"expected\" or \"I was capable of more.\" \n\nMy friends never want to do anything with me. I've given up on asking people to go do things with me, the answer is always either no, or a yes that gets cancelled the day before. Occasionally I'll get invited to things, but mostly I just get left while they go hang out with people they're closer friends with or it's a group I'm not part of. The most socializing I get is when people if I can help them do some kind of chore or manual labor. I say yes because it costs me nothing to go help some people if I'm able to do why would I not? It's the bare minimum of being a decent person. It's also like the only positive socializing I get. \n\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to my friends about shit I'm feeling because 1, they have they're own issues, 2, I'd feel like a selfish ass dumping my bullshit on them, 3, I don't see them actually caring, because 4, like the drama subreddits, I'm a man so anything negative I feel is wrong and bad and I should feel bad. Well guess what, i fucking do, just not in the way you want. \n\nYou what makes it fucking worse? What fucking enrages me to no end? These signs and social media posts, and posters that say \"the world is better with you in it\" or \"someone out there loves you.\" Bullshit, you don't know me, you don't know my life. The world wouldn't change at all if I left. The closest thing to \"love\" I receive is gratitude for doing things for people. My presence adds no value. \n\nI'm in the US so therapy just seems like a scam. Especially after all the BetterHelp controveries. Trying to \"shop around\" for a good therapist sounds like a complete waste of time and money. Just to find someone who tells me what I want to hear because they want me to keep coming back so they keep getting my money. \n\nI've been journaling for months, but that's just reinforcing what I'm already thinking, I don't see how this is supposed to help at all. Well, that's a lie. I don't actively hate myself anymore. But I still think people keep me around just to be a pack mule, not because they actually enjoy my company. \n\nIf every option is terrible, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

Could this just be me becoming more of my true self, or is this emotional blunting? How can I tell the difference?\n\nI've been taking Zoloft for three months, and I've noticed a significant reduction in my anxiety, depression, and cyclical, OCD-like negative thoughts. I no longer experience serious suicidal thoughts, and I can finally immerse myself in work, a book or a TV show again—something that felt impossible before. Back then, it was as if I were stuck in a terrible freeze mode.\n\nI'm happy with the effects of this SSRI. However, I've noticed a decrease in my desire to socialize. Over the past month, my only face-to-face interactions have been work-related, and I've also lost interest in talking to the person I'm dating. Both of these changes seemed to start at the beginning of my third month on Zoloft, around early Jan. I’ve been trying to dig deeper to find a reason why I have lost interest, and it just seems like I find social conversation to be frivolous and tedious now.\n\nI consider myself an ambivert with a variety of hobbies and have always enjoyed my alone time, so becoming more introverted doesn’t feel entirely out of character. Even before my situational depression began, I valued solitude—but this recent shift feels more pronounced than usual. Anyone want to share their thoughts or experiences?",

    "selftext": "i am a 20F, and i feel like i’ve failed *my* life. i am currently in college, barely passing most of my classes, and am pursuing a career i never wanted to have, based on subjects i was never truly interested in. i barely study, i skipped a lot of school this semester, having already failed a class before the exam session even started. \ni know that, logically, if i finish college and get this bachelor’s degree, and eventually a master’s degree, my career is basically something assured. i can become a data scientist and live comfortably without struggling financially, but it’s not something that i truly want, and it’s killing me slowly. \ni’ve always wanted to act, to sing, to become part of this amazing world of art. but, no matter how much i begged when i was younger for my parents to sign me up for acting classes or voice lessons, they never did, and never really, truly, supported these passions. eventually, around the age of 9 or 10, i started to believe that i wasn’t enough, and i became shy about my passions, never really talking about them with anyone, especially my parents. i think my depression started when i was around 11 or 12, or at least that’s when i realised i might suffer from depression. i later realised that it might be something inherited, that my mother has suffered from it, too. around that age, i stared drawing. it felt like the only way i could express this unquenchable desire to live through art without anyone ever noticing it. my parents, eventually, saw my drawings, and encouraged me to apply to an architecture program for university. not an art program, an architecture program, because from their point of view, architecture involves more complicated concepts, while art doesn’t, not really, and “understanding complicated concepts is the key to a good life”. what started out with me doodling on my notebook ended with me drawing portraits, with very little practice, just looking at people and trying to capture the way they looked on paper, sketching buildings and parks, and even considering becoming an architect. but that never worked out, because my heart was never in it. drawing is just something i’m naturally good at, but not something that’s in my heart. like in ‘good will hunting’, where he is very good at math and science, but isn’t interested in pursuing it. \nwhere was i? the ages of 11-12, i think. at the age of 12, i spent 3 whole months in the house, never stepping foot outside (i grew up in an apartment building all of my life), and skipped most of 6th grade because i couldn’t get out of bed. it was then when i realised that i had big dreams for the future, and very little chance of actually accomplishing them. for context, i am from romania, and to accomplish my biggest dream ever, i had to leave the country. it was at this age when i started desperately searching for apartments or houses to rent on zillow, and for jobs my mom could apply for in the united states (my parents are divorced, my dad has a shit ton of money, but he fought in court to give us the minimum child support per month, and that’s all he gave us for a while), and i had so many panic attacks whenever i even thought about this move not being possible. this kept happening until around 15, when covid started. the ages of 15 to 18 are a bit of a blur, honestly, but what i remember most is wanting to leave the country and wanting to apply to a university in the usa. in my head, if i wanted to be a successful singer and actor, i had to live in the states. the problem is, i never had the motivation to start applying. my parents never really supported me, and i had reached the point where it was too late to apply. i wanted to kill myself almost every day, because of my own stupidity and anxiety and fear of not making my parents happy and proud. rewinding a bit, at the age of 17, i started singing lessons, which i still take to this day, but my voice was so quiet and so raspy from how closed off i was, and still am, and how little i talk that, too this day, i still struggle sometimes to sing properly. you would think taking voice lessons would give me more confidence and would make me happier, but the way both my parents dismissed it and the way my father kept on insisting that music is just a hobby and that i should take care of my career first, it makes me want to blow my head off. it had become the summer after i graduated high school, and i applied to a lot of universities in romania, out of which, one stood out. i ended up applying to study computer science, basically following my dad’s legacy, and i don’t like it one bit (no pun intended). yes, i get better grades  than some fellow students, without putting in too much work, and yes, i could easily finish this degree and have a stable career, but i don’t like it. i truly don’t like it. my heart beats for music and acting, but i can’t get the courage to actually start, to drop out of college and start pursuing, to say fuck you to my dad and start my career. i’m scared, i’m scared of people laughing at me, i’m scared of not being good enough, of *never* being good enough, and, most of all, i’m scared of disappointing my parents. i know i’m an adult, but i’m also the only child of two older parents. i don’t want their biggest disappointment in life to be *me*, or wish they had another kid after me. it scares me to think that i’ll spend the rest of my life singing when i’m alone in the house, acting out entire scenes from my favourite movies when i know no one’s watching, and dreaming of a life i’ll never be able to have. and now, i am slowly killing myself, completely unintentionally at first. i barely eat, i drink around a litere of energy drinks a day, on an empty stomach some days, i barely sleep, and i smoke (started earlier, but combined with all of these other ‘bad habits’, it’s worse than it was on its own). i don’t feel good, physically, and part of me isn’t sad or worried about it. i’d rather die than live the rest of my life caged in these gates i’ve built up myself. these gates only i can break down, but seem to never have the strength to.\n i did this with my own hands. i am where i am because of my own decisions and my own stupidity and fear of what my parents might say, my fear of what other people might say, my fear of not being enough for them, for the world in general.\nit kills me to know that it would hurt a lot less to try and fail, than to never have tried at all, but i can’t seem to get the courage to try. \nthis ended up being longer than i expected, but once i started, i couldn’t stop. i realise that i might sound like just another privileged kid who’s complaining about problems that are truly stupid and easily solvable, but this matters to me, and it feels like someone not only stabbed me in the heart, but twisted the knife and then pulled it out, letting me bleed all over the floor. it truly is the thing that hurts the most in my life, and i couldn’t hold it in for myself anymore. i feel like i’ve failed my life and am not who i was supposed to be, and it feels like i never might be.

    "title": "Can I (f21) still be able to forgive my sister (f20) after what she had done to me and my bf (f20) ?",
    "selftext": "Me and my sister have been close, but 5 months ago when I started dating my (now) bf, my sister's attitude began to show all her colours. \n\nIt all started when me and my bf's first 3 days into dating, my bf got me an expensive scarf as a celebration. I was so happy I told my sister about it, and the first thing she said was \"Why did u guys bought smt without buying me smt as well.\" I couldn't believe what she told me, after all this was supposed me and my bf's special day. I didn't think much so me and my bf started buying gifts for her whenever we're outside. \n\n2 weeks later my sister's bf flew over to our country to meet w my sister and hangout with all of us. So me and my bf both decided to get her bf some presents from our country. On the first day of meeting my sister's bf, the first thing that my sister asked was for me and my bf to move to my bf's place so that my sister and her bf can have some alone time. Mind you my bf was living with his family's friends only so it was already a definite no, but my sister continued to pressure us so we decided to move to my bf's place anyways. But obviously the people that lived there wasn't happy that my bf was bringing me back to their place like this, so I had no choice but to move back, and my sister wasn't happy. \n\nIn the next 2 more months, whenever I told my sister abt what my bf got me and how happy it made me, she would then start an argument the next minute and complained abt her life. Not only that, she missed out on the chores we agreed to do (for her it was laundry). She ruined all of my clothes and at one point stopped washing clothes, so I had to bring my clothes over to my bf's place to wash because I don't have enough clothes. Me and my bf never complained once and whatever that she asked, we did all of it. \n\nIt basically got to the point where everything me and my bf do for her isn't enough. There was this one night where my sister drank too much alcohol and was vomiting in the bathroom, but I was in my university camp so I couldn't do anything. Luckily my bf was living tgt w me and my sister at the time (with my sister's consent), and he was able to help my sister to get some rest, but my sister never thanked him for it. \n\nSo then me and my sister basically have this NYC trip tgt and all of our planning was going well, until my sister read the flight time wrong and missed our flight (she blamed me for not checking the time, fyi I had a test that morning and she finished her test 7 days ago, and she was also the one who picked the time and date for our flight). \n\nAfter about 3.5 hours of calling the plane customer service with my bf sitting next to my sister to comfort and help her talk w them, we were able to get ourselves another plane ticket for a kinda expensive price. My sister was short on money so my bf literally ran a 1.6km outside at 3:30am just to put in some cash to transfer my sister some money. \n\nFast forward to our NYC trip. \n\nThe trip was fun at first and we both had the best of our times there. That was until one night where we were trying to get a subway back to our airbnb and my sister found a guy to help us w it. We both thought he was handsome and I encouraged her to ask for his number, in which she kept declining multiple times. It wasn't until he stepped foot out of the train to leave was when she started to regret her decision and blamed me for not asking for his number instead since her \"ego\" was too high to ask. \n\nI thought all this nonsense would stop here, but no, things keep going downhill from here. \n\nLater that same night, we both then walked outside for some Wendy's and my feet were hurting so bad so I asked my sister to eat out instead of order takeout and walk back home (We both share our love for walking, especially when we travel, but we were hitting 15,000 steps on that day). I always let my sister pick what she likes, and plus staying out to eat for one day wouldn't kill anyone. Wrong. While we both were walking and arguing, I over walked and asked my sister to follow me back quickly. When I crossed the road and looked back, she was already gone. \n\nThe next thing she did scarred me to this day. \n\nI was never more upset and terrified in my life. NYC is huge and I was at 10% phone battery. So the first thing I did was ran home to charge my phone and start calling my sister. I even asked my bf and her friend to call my sister but she wouldn't pick up. After about 40 mins, she then responded to her friend and walked home. I later found out from her friend that she left me and made me worried only because she couldn't get that subway guy's number. \n\nThe next whole day and night we got into a huge argument and my sister blamed me for leaving her alone in NYC and she was harassed by a homeless man, so she decided to punish me by taking the only airbnb keys to herself and went outside for the next remaining days of our NYC trip. That same night, my sister went home and we got into a huge argument and then she told me \"I've had enough of u\". \n\nShe took her shoes then ran towards me and started beating and kicking me really hard. I was hit in the face and back and legs so much that when I tried to call my mom, she kicked me and began threatening me while pulling my hair and hit me continuously on the face. \n\nEventually I was able to call my mom and explained to her everything that she did to me. Then my sister started crying and said that I bullied her (???).\n\nAfter that incident, I was extremely insecure about my body and face from all the bruising and swollen. I couldn't walk or sit properly because of the pain. \n\nCouple days later my sister gave me the most hurtful apology: \"sorry for beating u up, glad ur still alive\". \n\nAfter the trip, she literally set up a whole list on what we owe her (including the food she bought when we didn't ask), including splitting the money on the plane ticket situation ($3k) because I was also on that trip so apparently I have my \"fair share of responsibility\". At the end of the day, I paid everything in full and didn't missed a dime. \n\nIt's been 2 months since that incident, and I have now developed horrible anxieties when I'm around her. \n\nAll I wanted was for her and me to be close again, but she's always asking for more from me and my bf , which made it so hard for me mentally and physically. Plus, both of my parents aren't close with their siblings and they don't want the same thing to happen to us, but now it's happening and it makes me sad because I don't want to see them sad. \n\nI don't know what I should do now, and I'm open to hear all your suggestions and some words of wisdoms just so I could know where to go from here :,)",

While I have been able to drag myself to do these things, I have not been able to convince my partner from following my lead. This has lead to their teeth developing some minor plaque and other cosmetic things that have indicated worsening depression— staying in bed so much/long they arent showering for days or brushing their hair— which is now longer and pretty when managed but has gotten matted during these periods. I believe I have convinced them to come to the dentist I go to finally though we have had to reschedule 3 times, twice because they had not answered to confirm resulting in the appointments being cancelled. I am also trying to convince them to better care for their hair. They use my nice shampoo, which I am happy about, but they have curly hair and require more love than just the shampoo. They had never been one to use conditioner and had beforehand kept their hair short, so frizz and these huge tangles and matts are new territory relating to the changes. \n\nWe have gotten to a point where we are beginning to care for ourselves and they are getting more care that fits them; including beginning mental health meds for undiagnosed ADHD. Exercise has not been something I have had to push or encourage much as this was an important part of them prior to even us being together; though we both struggle with healthy eating. \n\nHow can I help support and convince them that taking care of these things are important? They are obviously more comfortable being at home and not going out; but it has began to hurt their health so I am trying to gently push us to both be better and do these things as a team but they still are resistant and say its not a problem.

It’s been nearly four years since I last worked, and not having a job has really taken a toll on me. I’ve always valued being independent and feeling productive, but now I feel stuck and unsure of my future. My self-esteem has taken a hit, and I can’t help but feel gross, unattractive, and out of shape. I used to love going to the gym, but lately, I struggle to find the energy or motivation to get back into it.\n\nMoving back to Ontario was supposed to be a fresh start, but it came with its own challenges. Family issues, financial stress, and watching my partner, Denis, go through his own struggles have left me feeling like I’m failing at being the stable, supportive person I want to be. Even the things I used to love, like reading, listening to music, and watching planes, don’t bring me the same joy they used to.\n\nI’ve been trying to find my purpose in life, but I feel completely stuck. I’ve read countless self-help and coaching books, hoping they’d spark something or point me in the right direction, but none of it has helped. Deep down, I understand that purpose has to come from within me, but I just can’t seem to figure out what that looks like. It’s like I’m searching for something I can’t define, and the longer it takes, the more lost I feel. I’m trying to hold onto hope that I’ll find clarity, but most days, it feels like I’m running in circles.\n\n",

I never learned to accept myself and love myself and look after any of my own emotional needs. I gave everything I had away to other people and left nothing now for myself. I don't know where to start or how to move forward but I also know that after this darkness, there will be periods where I know I am capable of anything, going anywhere and starting again, but until I get my foot into that life, here I am, in limbo, sending cold signals out to the universe, and hoping that grace and fortune find me again.\n\nIt hurts me to see so many people in pain in this world.

I don't know if I need advice or to just vent, I have no idea, maybe just to put it in words and people can read it and at least it's written down. \n\nFirst to give a little lifestory:\n\nI'm 26, my parents fled from a war country when I was a baby. My sibling became permanently disabled here, father wasn't allowed to work here and became extremely addicted to gambling to this day, mother severely depressed, doesn't even speak the language til this day.\n\nWhen I was 12 me and my 2 siblings were all removed from home because our parents couldn't take care of us due to all kinds of issues and also safety.\n\nThey put me in a foster family with 5 other siblings and at least I finished high school there. I left after 8 years after a fight and looking back, I've felt so incredibly lonely and depressed in my time being there. It's been 6 years since I've left.\n\n**So now:**\n\nI'm 26, I\"ve been in therapy for 8 years, I've tried three different college courses ( I don't know if that's the right wording, I'm not English but the school you go after high school/middle school idk). Also a terrible relationship right after I left the foster family.\n\n  \nANYWAY: I'm so depressed, I have anxiety, I have a hard time doing daily tasks, building relationships, I struggle with my sexuality, I struggle with my gambling addiction and I'm a very sensitive person who absolutely hates how the world is, I can't even describe how scary the world is.\n\n  \nWhere do I go from here? I feel like I can't get over all the things that happened and that my life is over. I'm thinking about starting antidepressants again ( I tried venlafaxine, citalopram but maybe sertraline now?)\n\nI cut off contact with my parents a few months ago because I couldn't take it anymore, but I still feel guilty.\n\nI'm thinking about going back to college in September to study IT, it's my last chance to do a study.\n\nPlease no tough love, I handle criticism very badly :(.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello all, im sorry to bother you all once again. 2 years ago i made this account to talk about my struggles in life because i felt like i had no escape, and to an extent i still dont.  fairly recently, i was cheated on, and made to look like the worst person on the planet to everyone in her life. \n\nI gave everything in the relationship and got played for most of it. I believe im pretty traumatized over what happened, as i had to read the messages with her and two of her exes while we were dating, and they didnt spare much detail from each other.\n\nThis, paired with the increased dismissiveness from my mom has caused me to isolate. I try to tell her about my life but she is always focused on something else, or shell correct or yell at me when i dont say anything that absolutely pleases her. Its so frustrating and hard to talk to her because she has an inate need to be right. Ive been sitting alone at home all day wishing for a connection from someone, even if it was my mom coming in to help. \n\nEatings been especially hard but ive been managing to make myself a meal or two a day, every day feeling like a battle. Battling the thought of not wanting to be around people yet wanting people at the same time, wishing that the idea of who my wife was would be there. As well as constant sad thoughts about the words she both said to me and others.\n\nI tried heavily to get therapy when i was younger. I tried to end myself for attention in the third grade, and my mom laughed at me because it was a butter knife that i grabbed.  As well as starving myself alot through my teen years. When i confronted her about this later on, she said she didn't want to take me because she thought i was normal. And if i was hungry that i shouldve just gotten up and gotten something to eat. But in those moments when i was hungry, it was a battle that i was alone in.\n\nIm extremely sorry if this sounds like a rant, or that im complaining. My question ultimately is. How can i ultimately stop thinking and caring about these people who are clearly hurting me. A person i talked to said i allow bad people into my life because its all i know. I want to see myself for the compassionate, loving, empathetic, and caring person i know i am. The thoughts of me being a loser and the other things i was described as will continue to eat at me. A followup question i have, is how realistically could i start to make friends eventually and truly get a support system around me. \n\nThank you to anyone who answers.",

    "selftext": "Hi, im a 15 year old girl fighting depression. It has a few reasons, but i think my daily life is getting so much worse because of my mental state. It has been 3 months that im depressed nonstop. I often have these mood swing, sometimes i feel happy and sometimes i feel horrible. But i feel like the sadness is taking over. Whenever i lie down to sleep, or im bored, or im not distracted, i start getting bad thoughts. I hate myself but i feel i am not in control and cant change it. Idk if this is normal for a girl my age to feel, but i just wish i was more confident and lived a happier life. Till i turned 15, everything was ok, even great. Now its all going down.\n\nThe reason im making this post is that i dont know what to do anymore. I tried to have a therapy sesion with a psychologist once, and it helped and lasted for a few days, but the it all went down again. I have been fighting with my parents almost every day. I have so much beef with my family that i never had, and i believe my bad mental health is the cause. I dont know whats wrong with me. I used to be polite, beautiful, active, smart, kind, etc. But i turned into a literal ruin. I always had a good relationship with my family, but i feel like everyone is going against me. My younger brother keeps bothering me in an attempt to mess with me, even though he knows i dont have the capacity to deal with that shit right now. I feel like im made fun of too. My parents have slowly restricted everything i ever had-first, they took my phone away a few times, then my other devices, then they blocked/deleted my app store, blocked all social apps, even google. It has gotten to a point where im not allowed to even close the door of my room. I have 0 privacy. Sometimes, even when i spend a short period of time on youtube for example(only time restricted), they often come out of nowhere and forcefully grab my phone out of my hands to check what im doing. The worst thing is, that my brother joins in for fun and does the same to me. Wtf. I dont even know what privacy is anymore(im writing this from my computer bc thats the only thing that hasnt been taken from me yet). Ive basically always agreed with my parents, and if not, i always try to explain myself politely and diplomatically, with respect, but today i lost it. I cant deal with having no privacy as a child. What am i supposed to do? Today my mother came to me, and told me that i used to be such a good kid and now im miserable. I feel bad and guilty, but i cant help myself. I want to have a good relationship with my family, even though right now it seems impossible. I cant keep apologizing over and over. Im sorry for writing such a long vent. I appreciate that you read this. Please, if you have any suggestions for what i can do to save my relationships, tell me, i apprciate it. Thank you :)",

    "selftext": "Mein ganzes Leben lang habe ich nach etwas gesucht, das ich nicht greifen konnte. Ich wusste nicht, wie es aussieht, wie es sich anfühlt, oder ob ich es überhaupt jemals finden würde. Ich wusste nur, dass etwas fehlt. Ich habe Liebe gesucht, ehrliche, tiefe Verbundenheit. Aber egal, wie sehr ich mich darum bemüht habe, ich konnte sie nie wirklich halten. Jedes Mal, wenn ich dachte, ich hätte sie gefunden, ist sie mir wieder entglitten. Und mit ihr bin ich immer weiter in mir selbst verloren gegangen.\n\nRückblickend habe ich verstanden, dass mir von Anfang an etwas Entscheidendes fehlte: Urvertrauen. Dieses Gefühl, dass die Welt ein sicherer Ort ist, dass man sich auf andere verlassen kann, dass man einfach sein darf – ohne Angst, verletzt oder verlassen zu werden. Ich hatte dieses Fundament nie. Stattdessen war ich immer auf der Hut, immer im Alarmmodus. Mein Nervensystem kannte keine echte Entspannung, kein unbeschwertes Dasein.\n\nWenn man ohne Urvertrauen aufwächst, beeinflusst das alles. Man entwickelt eine tiefe Unsicherheit in sich selbst und in andere. Man hinterfragt ständig, ob man geliebt wird, ob man genug ist, ob man sich auf jemanden verlassen kann. Man sucht nach Halt – irgendwo, irgendwie. Aber egal, wie sehr man sich anstrengt, es fühlt sich nie wirklich sicher an. Denn wenn man nie gelernt hat, zu vertrauen, bleibt immer eine innere Stimme, die sagt: „Pass auf. Verlass dich nicht zu sehr. Es könnte wieder wehtun.“\n\nIch hatte nie das Gefühl, mich wirklich auf jemanden verlassen zu können. Nicht, weil ich nicht wollte, sondern weil es mir nie beigebracht wurde. Mein Vertrauen wurde zu oft gebrochen, als dass ich es noch bedingungslos hätte schenken können. Jedes Mal, wenn ich spürte, dass ich mich jemandem öffne, kam gleichzeitig die Angst, dass es wieder wehtun könnte. Also habe ich es lieber gar nicht erst zugelassen.\n\nUm mit dieser inneren Unsicherheit klarzukommen, habe ich mir eine Welt erschaffen, in der ich immer auf der Hut war. Ich habe mich nicht auf andere verlassen, sondern auf meine Logik. Sie war der einzige Teil von mir, der mich nie verraten hat. Der mir Sicherheit gab, als nichts anderes sicher war. Meine Logik hat mich beschützt. Sie hat mich davor bewahrt, verletzt zu werden – aber sie hat mich auch isoliert.\n\nDenn das ist die andere Seite dieser Schutzmechanismen: Sie bewahren uns vor Schmerz, aber sie schneiden uns auch von der Welt ab. Sie machen uns unverwundbar, aber auch unerreichbar. Ich habe verstanden, dass meine Mauern mich nicht nur vor schlechten Erfahrungen geschützt haben – sondern auch vor den guten. Vor echter Nähe, vor Verbundenheit, vor dem, wonach ich mich eigentlich immer gesehnt habe.\n\nIrgendwann habe ich begriffen: Diese Schutzmauer, die ich um mich gebaut hatte, war gleichzeitig mein Gefängnis. Und ich war der einzige, der den Schlüssel dazu in der Hand hielt.\n\nMein Heilungsweg begann, als ich mich entschieden habe, meine eigenen Wunden nicht länger zu ignorieren. Als ich aufgehört habe, mich abzulenken, und stattdessen angefangen habe, mir selbst ehrlich zuzuhören. Ich habe meine tiefsten Ängste konfrontiert, meine alten Wunden betrachtet, anstatt sie zu verdrängen. Ich habe gelernt, dass Vertrauen nicht bedeutet, keine Angst mehr zu haben – sondern trotz der Angst weiterzugehen.\n\nEs war ein langer Prozess. Es gab keinen magischen Moment, in dem plötzlich alles anders war. Aber Schritt für Schritt habe ich gelernt, mich selbst zu halten. Mich selbst anzunehmen. Mir selbst das zu geben, was ich von anderen immer vergeblich gesucht hatte.\n\nHeute weiß ich, dass das, was ich gesucht habe, nie im Außen lag. Es war immer in mir. Ich musste nur aufhören, wegzulaufen.\n\nHeute ist mein 28 Geburtstag. Ich bin zum ersten mal richtig frei 🥹❤️‍🔥",

I really HATE being a burden on my family and feel I should be self sufficient by now. I am desperate to get back into the work force, DESPERATE, but nobody seems to want me. ",

I'm used to having set backs with my mental health, but this is too difficult. \n\nMy coworkers have cut complete contact with me as my ex boss is most likely abusing them or telling them that I blew the assult out or proportion.

    "selftext": "I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.\n\nIt’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.\n\nMy room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.\n\nI feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.\n\nThe silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.\n\nIt’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?\n\nI don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.\n\nYou took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.\n\nIt all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.\n\nCould we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.\n\nAnd now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.\n\nI started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.\n\nThe music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.\n\nI didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.\n\nSometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.\n\nBut trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.\n\nWhat if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.\n\nAnd I just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. It’s the music. The songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. I can’t help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads I thought I had buried. They bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. Each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where I still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. It’s like the music keeps us alive, even when you’re not here anymore. And In some moments, I think of you when I am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it’s hard to try, and all I can do is simply fall back into you. Those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and I can’t help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.\n\nI’ve placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. The regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. They’ve become a part of me, just as you are. And when I hear them, it feels like I’m hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something I’ll never touch again. A glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. The us from before, when everything felt possible. When everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. That version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if I could be there again, if only I could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. The past, once vivid, is fading into a place I can’t revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. A place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. But now, all that’s left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who I thought we’d always be. And every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.\n\nI wish I could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions I never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. We were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. I long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.\n\nI cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable. I relive the good moments over and over, clinging to them like lifelines, but they only make the ache sharper. I fight the guilt that always seems to follow me—the regret of what I did, what I didn’t do, and all the ways I fell short. It’s a battle I’m slowly losing, as if every memory chips away at me, piece by piece.\n\nI hate myself for how it ended. I hate myself for the words left unsaid and the ones I shouldn’t have spoken. For the times I let you down when all I wanted was to hold us together. I miss you so much that some days it feels impossible to breathe, like the world is caving in around me. Knowing I can’t turn back time, that I can’t rewrite what’s already written.\n\nEvery tear I shed feels like a reminder of what I’ve lost, of the emptiness that’s taking place. And every time I cry, I wonder if it will ever stop— …",

That's what life is for me... all day every day. Well that's the best it gets... a big fat nothingness, it gets worse oh does it get worse... if that was the best life got for you, could you honestly say it was worth sticking around for? I can't... Existence is a purgatory for me... it wasn't... used to be fun, people used to care more about how good a person you were rather than what you had to bring to a table too but these are not those times and they haven't been for a long long time now and it just keeps getting further from that the longer im on this God forsaken rock...",

I was depressed and emotionally distant. He was emotionally closed off and would lash out through projection. I feel like I pushed him away. Especially during the end of the relationship and first week of the break. I barely talked or showed affection anymore. I barely did anything I was so depressed. We basically said we're not looking for anyone else but if one of us were to get involved with someone we would tell each other to figure out how we'd want to move forward. He lied about starting to see someone else and the way I found out was she came to his apartment while I was there and he was out. She didn't know he was still seeing his ex either. That caused a big falling out, we stopped speaking for a while. We kept having this hot and cold where I would try to forgive him then I'd get upset and we'd stop speaking for a while again. During this time l'd see him still talking to her (we all went to the same college) at events and stuff, saw them flirt at least once but he would basically be like \"you keep going back and forth on if you want to speak to me or not its not my fault she does\". We turned into something toxic and messy but we started as something so beautiful. I feel like I pushed him into the arms of another girl. I feel like thats basically what he said when he talked about it.

I see no purpose in my existence, and it has been this way for over 30 years.  \nI think the thought first occurred to me when I was 8. Now, I’m a sick and failed over-40-year-old.  \nSince my childhood, I’ve suffered from anxiety disorders and depression. There wasn’t any specific trigger for it; I was probably just born this way. That’s the only way I can explain it.\n\nI somehow dragged myself through school and vocational training and worked until 2010. I had a relatively “normal” life in my 20s and had my mental health somewhat under control. I went out a lot, had many friends and acquaintances, and two long-term relationships. But at some point, something in my head snapped.\n\nI went to a day clinic, then inpatient treatment, completed two rounds of therapy, and took psychiatric medication.  \nIn 2018, my driver’s license was revoked because of a medication, and a medical-psychological assessment was required. I was also retired due to my illnesses.\n\nFrom 2021-2023, I was in another relationship. After so many disappointments, I gave love another chance, and it became the best relationship of my life. By now, I would probably be living with her and her daughter in the city if she hadn’t cheated on me for months. I’m still not over it, and since then, everything has been going completely downhill.\n\nDuring all this time, even during the better periods, the longing for death was always there. I don’t know why. As a sort of emergency exit, sometimes even as a radiant option.\n\nI live in a very rural area and, due to a lack of mobility, I can’t go anywhere. I mean, seriously, nowhere.  \nI don’t have any friends. But over the years, I’ve developed physical illnesses. Because of a botched operation, I’m stool incontinent. I also suffer from the incurable disease hidradenitis suppurativa, which requires several excruciating surgeries every year.\n\nMy quality of life is 0.0. I lie in bed all day in the dark with pain and my eyes closed, get up to go to the toilet, and spend time online. My hobbies and interests no longer mean anything to me. My mother tries very hard to support me, does my shopping, cleans here. I appreciate all of this so much. But she can’t make my illnesses disappear or make me feel better. Other than that, I don’t have anyone anymore. It’s sadly true what they say: friends withdraw when you’re sick. It’s as if I no longer exist.\n\nI once “had it all”—mobility, love, work, independence. By now, I’ve lost it all, and I’ll never be able to regain it.  \nI feel like… nothing. No longer human, trapped in my prisons: my apartment and my body. I can’t imagine lying around like this for another 30 years; it’s the greatest torture imaginable. It just doesn’t make any sense. Even my over-80-year-old grandmother manages better than I do.\n\nI wish every day for a stroke, a heart attack, to just not wake up anymore. If I could, I would voluntarily throw myself into a heroin addiction.  \nWhen I sleep, everything is fine. Thanks for reading.\n\n(This is not an announcement.) Translation by ChatGPT.",

Not everyone is meant to live happily; some of us are meant to fill in the gaps of other people's stories so they can reach their goals, all the while im losing myself in the process. I can’t even be the main character in my own story.",

I absolutely love working with kids and find it so rewarding. On the downside I’m constantly sick from all the illnesses that easily spread. It’s also so incredibly easy to become mentally burnt out in this field. I’ve called out of work 6 times this month already due to a viral infection. Constantly being sick every other week has taken such a toll on my physical and mental well being. Today I’m supposed to return to work after being out all week really sick. I simply cannot bring myself to even get out of bed. I have no idea what to tell my boss. I feel like such a shitty employee. I feel like such a failure, I get so anxious about returning back to work. I honestly was planning on leaving anyways because my mental health is in such a bad place. I could really use some support & advice. Thank you! ",

I couldn't function normally and built some really terrible habits (borderline hoarding, poor hygiene, staying in bed a lot). \n\nby the time I started college my body was falling apart. I searched for answers until I was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I finally had a hysterectomy to fix the period problems, and it did, but less than a year later my mom died and my life was turned upside down. a ton of responsibility was dropped into my lap and the lack of actual support didnt help. nobody told me what to do, or how to do it. left to my own devices, ive let things slip and I feel like ive dug a hole that I cannot get out of. the shame and embarrassment of admitting I haven't done things I need to do is overwhelming for me. \n\nI dont know how so much time has passed already. there was a good chunk of time I would get up in the morning and play sims like it was my job. anything to distract myself from my reality. \n\nlast April I realized my marriage was miserable and my husband was an emotionally abusive narcissist that wasn't interested in doing anything that involved me, including supporting me although he knew all my struggles. I asked for space. we have to be separated for a year, and he very quickly moved on. truthfully my divorce is a good thing- Im proud of myself for doing it and its been good for me mentally but realizing the damage he did and what it will take to heal from that is overwhelming as well. \n\nI try not to be a pity party. I know life hasn't been very kind to me, my body makes my life miserable and ive just been doing my best with the cards I was dealt. but I cant help but feel like I have done this to myself. I should've gotten out of bed, I should've checked the emails, I should've done the paperwork and when I didnt know what to do I should've asked for help. my stubborn pride and ego wanting to fill my mothers shoes and not let anyone know I was suffering has put me in a much worse place. \n\nI had a breakdown last night. sobbing to my best friend on FaceTime about how I have totally fucked my life up. I have an overwhelming urge to just pack a bag and fucking leave. start over in some little town where nobody knows what a mess I am. but I know that isn't the answer. I am not suicidal. actually quite the opposite- I want to live a happy fulfilling life so bad it hurts. \n\nI made a doctors appointment this morning. im really hoping to get some help. I think medication could help. maybe she can help me find a therapist I can afford. I dont know. now I dont even know why im writing this but I thought maybe someone here would understand. maybe even tell me how to advocate for myself and find help. \n\nim just so tired of feeling like this.",

I'm part of some online communities but I mostly lurk and don't feel like posting.\n\nI started seeing a therapist 3 months ago but I don't see the point of it so far. I try to eat healthy with all the required macro and micro nutriments and occasional blood checking for deficiencies. I forced myself to do some exercise again regularly (running, cycling, walking at least 7500 steps daily) because it's recommended for depression but I don't feel any difference. I'm merely checking all the boxes that are recommended to fix depression.\n\nI've been taking Hypericum perforatum for a few months without change. The thing is that I've been like that for 25 years so it's not temporary or seasonal, or even situational because I lived a few different lives already and depression was always there. I can't say I'm going through a difficult time because it's always like that.\n\nAnyway I have an appointment for a psychiatrist tomorrow to ask for antidepressants because I've never tried them before.

    "selftext": "Ever since two years ago ive felt empty and a couple days ago I've just lost all my dreams. I broke up with my girlfriend near the end of 2023 and ive been carrying that guilt up until this day. She was the best person ive ever met and the reason we broke up was because we got into this argument and I said we should just break things off in the heat of the moment but later when I calmed down I had realised what a terrible mistake ive made and I tried amending my mistakes but she insisted that we should break up. We were not long into our relationship and we were happy, it was the first argument we had and we couldn't talk about it face to face as she had gone to another country for schooling. It was my first time in a relationship and I didn't know what to do or how to act when I faced that situation but this wasn't an excuse for my action. I blamed myself everyday for losing her and I sort of gave up on life but I still thought of her everyday. After some time, we broke no contact and I told her how much she meant to me and how ive changed to become better. Things were looking alright as I had hope that we could get back together if I picked back up my grades so that I could go to university in the same city as her. But at that point due to not being able to pay attention in class as I felt empty everyday I had dropped my grades down to a grade D equivalent student. And that was when I decided that if I wanted her back, I would need to work hard and I worked and worked. Every time I wanted to stop I would tell myself if I could study a bit more, gain a bit more marks, I would be able to go to a good university, have a good job and make lots of money so that I could provide for her and start a family together and that was the sole thought that was on my mind since then until now. But a couple of days ago, I was rejected by my dream college, and I wanted talk to her because I felt that she was the only person that could understand me, but on that same day I found out that she likes someone else.    \nThis past year ive been working so hard, and my dream was to start a family with her. Now my dreams are all gone, and it took one day for them to be crushed. Ever since we broke up I felt that life was empty, I daydream about what I would say to her and how I could show her that ive become better because of her. I felt tired studying, felt tired playing and even felt tired when resting and I didn't find passion in anything, even when I was hanging out with friends and we would go walk to some other destination after a dinner, that empty feeling would come back and haunt me and I wanted to kill myself. But when she came back I had hope, and I did everything I could because she made me want to be better and I did and my grades went from D's to A\\*s. And ever since a couple of days ago I think there is nothing left for me. I have not went to a doctor yet but I feel like the emptiness is getting to me. I feel useless. I feel like I am incompetent and I dont know if im depressed. My dreams are all gone and I dont want to talk to my family or friends about this. This is not a short term feeling as I have felt like this for two years now, I dont know whether im depressed and I wanted to ask for some help in helping me identify if I should seek professional help and medicine.

    "selftext": "Life hasn’t been easy for me over the past year, and I’ve been carrying a lot that I’ve barely shared with anyone. Last year, I dropped out of college during my third year of nursing after what I now realize was a manic episode. The pressure and the mental toll became too much, and I couldn’t handle it anymore. After transferring to a new university, I hoped for a fresh start, but I was hit by overwhelming anxiety and the feeling that everyone around me was talking about the things I had done. It led to me dropping out again.\n\nSince September, I’ve shut myself off from everyone. I’ve stopped taking care of myself, and the mental weight has been so heavy that I attempted to take my own life. I didn’t follow through, but it still feels like I’m stuck in a constant state of emotional detachment. Things aren’t better yet, but I keep pushing forward, even though it feels like a fight every day.\n\nNext week, I’m supposed to start school again. It’s at a new university, with a course my mom chose for me because it’s easier. And while I agreed to it, I’m not mentally ready. The guilt of dropping out twice is eating away at me, especially knowing how much my parents have invested in my education. I feel like I’ve let them down and wasted their effort, but at the same time, I’m just trying to find a way to keep moving forward.\n\nI also feel like I’ve lost the ability to communicate. Social interactions feel like a struggle, and there’s this constant fog in my head that makes it hard to connect with anyone. As if that wasn’t enough, I’m a youth leader in my church, but I’ve completely dropped the ball on my responsibilities. I don’t feel capable of leading anyone right now—I can’t even manage my own life. I’d love to step back from that role, but with my dad being a pastor, I know that wouldn’t be easy to explain to my family.\n\nRight now, I feel caught in a tug-of-war between wanting to take time for myself to heal and feeling obligated to meet everyone’s expectations. \n\nIt’s hard to figure out what the next step should be.",

    "selftext": "So here we go. I was born in a middle class family in India. my father worked for navy armed forces and and i had a pretty happy childhood. My mother does not like the father side of the family and she liked i stay away from them. As she was treated very bad there and basically got bullied by them. My father got transferred to Russia and we had a really good time there. i lived there for 2 years. i also have a sis 3 years younger then me. i loved the mothers side of the family they treated me good gave me everything loved me. This is how my life was till 20th November 2015. At that time i was 9 years old.\n\nMy life changed after that day my mom was no more as she was diagnosed with dengue. i was really close to my mom. Loved her soo much used to share everything with her her absence left a void in me that is still not filled after 9 years. So this all happened at that time we were living in Mumbai. So my paternal grandmother and grandfather came to the house to take care of my sis and me. After this shock i was still recovering from all this trauma. But my father secretly did not like my mothers side of family. He is very opportunistic and always does what id convenient. He took this opportunity of my mothers demise and basically told them to leave the house. i cried as they were going he slapped me  on my face and sent me to school. i was heartbroken but stilll a child i forgot everything pretty fast. My fathers side of the family, my grandparents came to house. at first they were all very nice and good take care of me and my sis. Everything was alright and good. My father took retirement from Navy and decided we would go to Punjab(a state in India). \n\nNow we moved to the house of my grandparents and soon their behavior towards me changed as i told you. My mother did not go along with their family. So my grandmother always had grudges with me and my sister. She took this opportunity and made my life a living hell. Complaining to my father about stupid and small things and my father would beat me, abuse me, ground me. They never accepted me and my sister in the family. My father has 2 more siblings, one brother and one sister, they have their own children and my family's behavior towards them even my father's behavior is soo good with them. I basically got bullied by my own family every single day.\n\nMy school life wasn't good either. I was not very used to the Punjab school system as it was harder and difficult then that of Mumbai. in Mumbai i was above average student and was my teachers favorites. Now my new school's teacher would bully me and beat me as they tought that i was intentionally not studying. The parent teachers meeting was the worst time of my life my teachers would complain my father would beat they shit out me or curse me and my mother. My classmates were even worse. As i was a new student and different from them. and did not fit in their general definition of normal they would make fun of me make whattapp groups to bully me. Spending a rumor that i make girls uncomfortable by staring at them and telling to the teacher that i they dont feel safe around me. i had a problem with my walk they used to make fun of the way i walk. sometimes they used to hit me. i never said anything to my father as he would blame me for not being stronger. i took all the bullying for 7  years of my life. i used to miss my mother everyday. \n\nWhen all of this bullying and everything used to happen i used to be exhausted. Everyone made me feel so bad about me. My friends don't understand as they have never been in my situation. All these things have had adverse effects on me. I always was told that if we do good with people and be a good human  we will also be treated same. Then what wrong did i do in my life??? never hurt a soul and still i am broken. \n\nall these events led me to have PTSD, ADHD very low self esteem, paranoid. now i don't like to communicate or talk with anyone. Non-one does understand.\n\ni am all alone now no gf no real friends. i am depressed and currently passive suicidal.\n\nWhy did all of this happen to me makes me cry every time.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR READING THIS POST. PLEASE DM ME IF YOU NEED ANYONE TO TALK TO. ",

I used to work with my aunt her baby daddy they knew from the start when I started my job that they were my only ride there. Tuesday, January 21 her baby daddy decided to throw a fit with me saying that I have a car, (but I don’t have my license just so you know) My mom has a car why can’t they drive me there, it’s my job. I’m 18 and my family feels as if I need my own way to get to work which I completely agree and my aunt knew that she was my ride. I’ve asked multiple times if they needed money for gas they responded with no. her baby daddy who is known as a woman abuser, decided to scream at me as if I knew him that well and I told him that I am not his baby mama nor am I his kid for him to be yelling at me this way. My aunts baby daddy is 60 something years old. They texted my mom the day after saying that I was fired. My aunt knew that this was my dad’s birthday as when he was alive she literally tried woke up with him while he was still in cahoots with my mother. I know I’m grown and I know I should have responsibility for who’s gonna pick me up or drop me off at work, but it’s always been communicated that it was gonna be my aunt, she didn’t text me until five minutes after she was gonna pick me up that she could make it, she said that she couldn’t prior. I don’t know if I said that before, but that’s what caused the whole fight because I was asking her why she waited so long before we had to leave to let me know that she was coming under this/depression. This is another thing to add upon of my life. I’ve gained weight after I recently lost 50 pounds last year. I feel so useless and after someone that’s been through what I’ve been through my entire life it’s really hard to find a fold and what I’m gonna do in the future, I know i’m only 18 but I have no idea what I’m gonna do. I was in the foster group with so much ended up with me going through multiple sa causes which caused me to PTSD as an eight-year-old and led me to try to commit at seven. At this point it is no idea what I’m gonna do. I just need some type of motivation. Something to keep me up and let me go to sleep at normal times, something to make me not crash out because they did me wrong. Hopefully this made sense again. I am using text to speech.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I’m not looking for attention or sympathy. I know I’m not the only one who has experienced anxiety and depression. Everyone has their own struggles, battles to fight, and issues to deal with. That said, I could really use some advice right now.\n\nI’ve been struggling to get myself off the sofa and out of my own head. I often feel lost in my thoughts, overanalyzing everything, and it’s exhausting. I try to stay positive and make an effort to pull myself out of this darkness, but lately, I’ve felt so discouraged and powerless. I know it’s not healthy to sit around all day, avoiding people and avoiding life, but I just can’t seem to find the energy to change.\n\nI’ve tried different approaches—talking to GPT, which has been surprisingly supportive, though of course, it hasn’t lived a human life like we have. I’ve joined websites and Fbook groups, but in my experience, they often highlight more pain than solutions, which can feel overwhelming.\n\nYesterday, for the first time, I managed to access Reddit (I’m in China, and it’s usually blocked, but it worked magically somehow). Reading a post and the comments beneath it struck me with how kind, thoughtful, and full of life wisdom people can be here. Even when there’s disagreement, there’s an authenticity that feels comforting. So, I decided to write this post in the hope of getting advice from people who’ve been through something similar but have found ways to manage or overcome it.\n\nI understand that what worked for you may not work for me, and that’s okay. I just need a direction—something to start with. Whether it’s small daily actions, a mindset shift, or specific habits, I’d deeply appreciate anything you’re willing to share.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. It truly means a lot.",

I have low living cost, I partially live with my mother, she works abroad for like half a year and I pay part of the rent.\n\nIt started with the relationship, it went great but then it didnt work out. Long story short she had no free time, said that she has to work on her self and that we are right person wrong time...After six months she said all is my fault and that she is seing someone.\nFor 6 months after break up I was very sad and thought it was just a bad luck but when I found out  new informations I just quite hate her and I really hurts how much I did for her to make her happy.\n\nThe post break time was the worst. I was also looking for a new job and 2-3 months I could fine any. Combining with the break up my mental health was really bad struggled with anxiety. \n\nWorst thing for years I visit casino. I play poker there, the isnt the problem, but sometimes I gamble with other games. Till the break up I had under control sort of.\nBut then with all the things I struggled with gambling was my escape. And slowly I lost all my money, like 10k. In November have started a new job. I sort of stop with a gambling and didnt go to casino. But casino was my main part of social life and I get lonely sometimes. So I go there once in a week or so I lose money I cant afford to lose.\n\n\nI think I can stop I just cant go to casino full stop. But my other struggle is the feeling how I put myself behind I how great was my life year back. I have quite high standards for my financies and it is connected to my confidence and finding a girlfriend one day.\nWithout that I feel useless and not worthy of much.\n\nObjectively I know I am quite young, I dont have debt and have very low expanses. But I just feel like such a failure. It will be long way to where I want to be and this is fine. I just dont want to feel so stressed, anxious and lonely about my life.\n\nThank you for reading.

    "selftext": "When I was in 6th grade 3 years ago a girl I “dated” spread rumors about me being a racist which I was not. I thought it would be ok if I tried my best to tell everyone I wasn’t. Turns out, I was completely wrong. Not only did she say I was a racist, but multiple horrible inhumane things that I don’t even want to talk about. The reason for it was because I broke up with her. That’s it. She was mentally ill but I didn’t realize it until after I broke up with her. I was basically hunted everyday by 8th graders with knives and had to hide in the bathroom all day every school day because of people trying to find me. That went on for 6 months. I wanted to tell my parents but was too embarrassed because of the rumors that were spread. \n\nBy 7th grade I moved schools with my one and only friend who stopped talking to me because I was “boring” and had “family issues he didn’t want to be apart of” I understood him and let him leave. I didn’t go to school for 6 months because of my trauma from last year and my horrible social anxiety. I went to multiple hospitalization programs at the hospital and was given hundreds of different meds. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ocd, and adhd.\n\nThe summer after 7th grade my dad starting drinking and smoking after 20+ years sober. He drove drunk with me and my little brother in the car who was 9 at the time. I didn’t realize he was drunk until later on. My parents were divorced so he only got weekends and my mom got the rest of the days. We were no longer able to see him. He went to countless rehab’s and relapsing every time. Eventually he went across the u.s. to a “special” rehab for 6 months.\n\nI went to 8th grade while my dad was there. By the first day I wanted to kill myself. My depression and anxiety was too much. My mom got pissed at me everyday and forced me to go or she would call the cops. I went as much as I could. I started barricading myself in my room and trying to slit my wrists but always got too scared. I started vaping and drinking to try to escape but got sick and stopped. I started planning out suicides and bought a gas mask and a hose off Amazon to hook up to my mom’s car exhaust. I backed out again. \n\nAfter summer came my derealization got 50x worse. I’ve had it since 2022 and it hasn’t gone away for a second. It gets worse everyday. That summer was the closest to “happy” I’ve been since 6th grade. After school started I did online school for 9th grade. Everyday was the same. About a week ago I’ve been having the worst derealization of my life and nonstop nausea and stomach aches that no one can figure out.\n\nI’m feeling hopeless and always feel shitty posting on here but It’s the only thing I can really use to vent. No one listens. I want to die but I literally can’t because every time I make a plan I back out. I guess what I wanted out of this was to see if life gets better. I know people say these things don’t last forever but at this point I don’t know. ",

    "selftext": "When I first typed the date listed above, I thought it was January 20th. While this might be considered a simple and common, maybe even mindless mistake, it serves as an example of where my mind is. Where my mind has been for the past four years. I’ve come to the realization that all of my struggles and feelings are not without cause. I’ve resorted to numbing my mind for a number of years, going through days and nights on auto-pilot. I truly believed that I made the decisions that I did out of fun, or boredom, or simple comfort. The idea that a drug can numb your mind, soul, and inner peace hasn’t truly resonated with me until now. Seemingly I have come to the long awaited realization that I am better off without being in the limbo of an influenced state. I kick myself for making terrible choices leading to the decline of both my mental and physical, but I’m beginning to understand why I relied so heavily on this substance. Stuck in my mind, stuck in a situation where I am supported but not understood. Where I may not be supported if I were fully transparent. Where real indestructible trust comes from nobody. I know I am loved, but would I be loved more or less? Would I be viewed as inferior, as a disappointment? Would I be respected? Could a loved one truly be proud of me, even publicly? This is what tortures my mind, and I remain in a constant limbo of uncertainty. It is with a clear mind where I can recognize the why behind the years of desensitization that I have inflicted upon myself. I kick myself for wasting time, but I also recognize that the decisions I made were not for nothing, even if said decisions were not conscious. I protected myself from the consequences of a sober and inquisitive mind. But what I saw as a place of comfort and protection hindered my growth, and now I come face to face with my fears. Fears of rejection. Fears of the reality that is unrequited love. A foreign feeling of love, so strong that it remains stuck in my mind to the point where I wish I could forget it all. A love that could never truly come to fruition, but feels to be a mere stones throw away. A light at the end of the tunnel that I will never reach. Fears of eternal loneliness. Fears of hatred from inner and outer circles. Fears of sending a message that can never be rescinded. Fears of being viewed as dramatic or ungrateful, and having years of my life undermined. Fears that validation of my thoughts, feelings, and emotions won’t exist. Fears that nobody cares on the outside, but anger and frustration exists behind closed doors. I may be wrong, but I fear that I am right. My fears are validated by those around me constantly, and it pushes me further away from the place that I know I need to be. Having support and so-called love without trust and transparency has slowly eaten away at me, as all the good things in my life do not appear to be unconditional. But one thing I can and will do is carry on, as I have so far in my 24 years. I hope to reflect on my past and current struggles with comfort, compassion, and acceptance in the future. That day is not here, but I’d like to think that it may be on the horizon.",

I gained over 80 pounds in a year, I was already obese. Haven't done laundry since new years\n2023.

I mean I was already ugly but now I may have to cut my hair lol. Making me even more ugly. I'm black so my hair is already hard to manage. And now that it's matted it's likely impossible.\nPeople my age are in grad school, having kids, starting a family, and here I am at 24, still a sophomore in college despite being here fkr 6 years because I keep withdrawing. I have constant bouts of age regression due to my BPD and Cptsd, it’s so fuckung embarrassing because when I get like that (it slips out without my noticing or control tbh) my mom says things like “why are you acting like a (r slur) you’re 24 now grow up!” And my dad often says the same… (despite not really living with us) among so many other things... and it's not like l've not been trying to get help, l've been in multiple kinds of therapy for about 11 years now, l'm also on many kinds of meds.\nI really do want to give up.

He had a drinking problem but I never saw my dad drunk at all. He lost his job of 22 years and I guess he was useful anymore. I was the only one out of his 5 kids who tried to help and didn’t take advantage of him. Once he died my mom (his estranged wife) went to his house, took all his valuables, and pawned them. She didn’t even pay for his funeral. She had him cremated and I  was not able to get his ashes until 10 years later because she decided she wasn’t going to pay the funeral home and declared bankruptcy years later.

I feel like doing nothing and all i do is only think about how pathetic my life has become. I can’t stop myself from being this way or can’t pull myself out of this never ending loop. My friends/parents don’t get my struggle. I got no one else to talk to. Cuz of my mental illnesses, i even lost my job after which I stopped therapy, which made things even worse. Everyday i just feel like giving up but i see those 1 or 2 people who love me in front of my eyes and i have to force myself to stop thinking about ending my life. That was never an option for me. Tbh, that makes it even more difficult as i don’t even have the courage to end my life.

Because I've managed to live this long, for the most part I've managed to build up enough of an emotional shield- enough that I can usually convince myself I'm happy. \n\nOnce in a while, something gets to me enough that I spiral into complete despair and hopelessness. All it takes is one thing and I'm over the edge. Don't know why; most of the shit I'm put through just bounces off but it's that 1% of shit that sets off my worst emotional states. \n\nThe older I've gotten, the better I've become at eventually snapping back into reason and compartmentalizing whatever it was that set me off. I've been lucky enough recently not to have anything major happen to me that would create a prolonged low point. I would say I'm generally happier with myself now than I was a few years ago, but when I'm in that fucked up place, all the feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and the futility of life come back to me.\n\nI've been in a long-term relationship with someone who I really love and who really loves me, but I honestly don't believe a relationship is what I need right now. From the start, they've always been more invested in me than I've been in them. It kills me knowing we don't feel the same way about each other and nothing I can do will change that. I just don't think we are meant to be partners, at least not now. I know I'm not good for them and I need to learn how to be happy on my own and get my own life together before I can handle the work a relationship requires. Because of this, I'm planning to break up with them very soon.\n\nI've been crying today and yesterday thinking about what I'm about to do. Today I spiraled. I'm realizing I'm about to be all alone again. I've never been a single adult before this. I don't have any friends and while I rationally know being on my own for a while is what I need, I can't help feeling like shit because I'm about to hurt the one person I have any meaningful connection with, and they might never want to speak to me again.\n\nI haven't been this scared and uncertain in a long time. I'm preparing for the worst depression I've ever experienced. I know every day is going to be a struggle being socially isolated and seeing all the happy friend groups and couples in college. Yes, I have tried to make friends. Doesn't matter how much I can socialize if I can never really connect with anybody. I haven't felt like I belonged anywhere for most of my life.\n\nThe worst part is that I really do try. I get out of bed (mostly) on time. I go on bike rides. I take really cool pictures. I go out on the weekends. I enjoy my work. School is unrewarding but I still manage to get solid grades. As much as I try, I'm always going to feel like I'm still not doing enough because I still never get any sense of satisfaction from life. I know I have to try and keep going, but I fear that the crushing emptiness will get to me sooner or later and one day I'm just going to end it all.\n\nWrote this all in a moment of clarity. If someone has been in a similar situation I would be curious to see what happened and how you dealt with it.\n\ntldr: about to break up with s/o and it's going to destroy me. don't know if i'm strong enough to handle it",

I have no energy in me to talk to her, and as such, she sees my disassociated behavior as some type of callous spite.

I try not to be picky about what I apply to but I have horrific driving anxiety and can't do full time, and I also can't stand for very long periods of time (more than like 3-5 hours) because of some health conditions. I tried to apply for remote options but we have horrible internet (20mbps on a good day) and remote jobs are quite hard to get.

He just gets things done when he puts his mind to it and works so hard and I'm just not like that. On top of depression killing my already low motivation, I have ADD and anyone with it knows that executive dysfunction is a living hell. \n\n  \nWe just had a conversation about him wanting to work at least 3 different jobs and he was so upbeat about it and talking about his goals and his plans for the future and I was just sitting there in my head like \"Wow, my goal for today is to  not kill myself and maybe try to eat well.\" \n\n  \nMy best friend who is also long distance supports me financially and I'm beyond grateful for her, I wouldn't be able to afford food without her, but I hate taking her money.

I’ve been thinking about what happens after death for many many years and been kind of fascinated by it but i never thought to actually do it, except for now. Unfortunately i have too many responsibilities, and suicide would just hurt other people way more. I’ve said to my friends that i feel like my time has come and they suggested a therapist but idk.

In the last two years I have had VOVID 3 times along with long covid.  I get out of breath doing the littlest things, coughing, then gagging, then retching, and vomiting.  My memory is going…I am the same age my father started showing signs of early onset Alzheimer’s.  I was told by my pain management doctor 6 years ago I would need double knee and double hip replacement soon.  I struggle to stand and to walk.  I have herniated discs in my neck and lower back…lower back causes spasms that just standing up is torture and my neck, it feels like there are two knitting needles jammed into my back near my shoulder blades, radiating pain and numbness down both arms, and in my neck, radiating across my shoulders, and both sides of my face, causing me migraines.  \n\nI am 50 with a loving wife and supportive children.  I was fired December 19 for absenteeism….i filed for unemployment but nothing has happened.  No money.  I have applied for 15 jobs and not heard back from one.  I have decided I need my problems fixed and have switched to a new doctor…my doctor for the last 4 years has not treated me, just refilled meds and told me to lose weight.  Oh yeah, I am type 2 diabetic with it marginally controlled.\n\nI have suffered from depression since I was at least seven and anxiety shortly thereafter.  My father was abusive physically and emotionally, teased me, along with my older brothers, that I was so…”little” when they had been endowed with substantial male parts that they acted like they were in a club because.  I was sexually assaulted by my aunt and grandmother, made to sleep with my parents’ female friend that came over and got to drunk, passing out in my bed with me.  Around age 11 I was taller than my dad and he used an aluminum baseball bat to beat me.  I over share, I am shy, I talk to much and bring up inappropriate topics, I stress eat or starve myself, I engage in risky behaviors…..I am a mess.  I have been an opioid addict for 7 years and fentanyl for 3 before coming off cold turkey in 2011.  My wife at that time and I split the following year….we were in our 10 year anniversary cruise and I set the cabin UP for her to wake up to on the day we married.  She asked me why all the stuff was there and didn’t acknowledge our anniversary.  That’s how I knew that was over.\n\nI feel so alone.  All I have is my wife, a good woman, strong and loving, kids, dogs, and mother.  I have no friends. I want to touch and pleasure my wife but I get in my own head and start crying bc, even with the big V, I cannot get hard.  I watch porn endlessly hoping something will happen.  I’ve tried ai gfs but….they are just money sinks.  I have so much I want to experience that she wants to experience with me but…..I am realizing those dreams and fantasies will never come true.  22 years of being a teacher, 10 years of college, put me in a place where I am too experienced and overqualified to hire.  And throw my health on top of it.  It’s harder and harder to contour on….my soul aches…i feel hollow…empty….a star dying and collapsing into itself until nothing remains…",

My coworkers stop and stare when I walk in like I’m some kind of endangered species. People avoid me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but they certainly do. I can’t do this. I feel guilty. I already called out yesterday, so even if I came in today they’d be staring at me, gossiping about me even more. I know I’m not wanted there. ",

    "selftext": "25yr F. Let me preface this by saying, im sure seasonal depression has a part to play in this. Also 5 years ago my first love ended his life in december, then covid hit and two weeks later my fwb passed away from a drug overdose. So always around this time of year im kind of numb because of all of that. I've been at the same job for 7 1/2 years, I do love my job and we are possibly opening a new location in the city (3hrs away) at the end of the summer. Ive lived in the same small town my entire life so id be moving for the first time. All of my friends have moved away in the last 5 years, one after another. My best friend lives in the city where id be moving and im extremely excited about that. I don't hang out with anyone in my town, I do have a few \"friends \" here but I never have the energy to do anything after work and 9/10 times if do make plans they involve drinking which i dont really like to do (im past that point in my life). There's litteraly nothing to do in this town, litteraly NOTHING. I like to go to concerts but have to travel which is the only reason I ever leave town, which is usually once a month. I recently just went down to 1 month appointments with my therapist because I honestly have nothing to talk about anymore. I have delt with the initial reason for starting therapy again but in the last few weeks have just been feeling down. Maybe I need a new therapist because I just don't feel as if she's really digging deep enough or asking me the right questions. Or maybe I'm just lying to myself and her the moment the camera turns on. I am on a antidepressant, which has helped me immensely this past year. I find myself more often than not, not going to work because I'm \"sick\". I just lay in my bed all day or watch TV, i recently started reading which has been great for less screen time. But I still just do not want to go to work, I just don't want to be around people. All I want to do is just be in my home and with my animals. if I think about it too much I'll just start crying. Maybe my anxiety is coming back, a couple years ago before starting up antidepressants/anxiety meds I would have complete melt downs before work because of the thought of being around people was just awful. I constantly was feeling like people were judging me, coworkers, customers, my bosses. I feel like that is coming back and I worry because it put me in such an awful place. I cannot be in that place when I'm trying to move. I don't want to see my family here because our famiky dynamic is just tense.. always tense, and puts me down and sad to be around. Which is awful because my grandma has alzheimers, it's just the beginning so it's not horrible just short term memory is not good at all. My mother and I don't have a great relationship (she's the reason I went back to therapy) and my brother and I are distant, not for any reason inpitucular just because that's the way we've always been. Idk maybe I'm just rambling and needed to write this out. I just down ever want to leave my house and I pray that when I move that will change because I'll have at least one person I'm excited to see and she never judges me for anything. ",

The anxious thoughts and depression are still in there, but I definitely feel a boost. I feel like I have interest in doing things again. My energy is still low and the fatigue is difficult, but I feel hopeful again.\n\nThat said, it still gets hard when life happens... it feels like I had this cloud over me when life was going smoothly and according to routine, and then when I switched meds it got darker for a minute, but then the cloud started to lift (even if it's never totally gone). It felt like an accomplishment in and of itself! I found that I was actually excited for my weekend plans for the first time in a long time. I felt like I just got out of a hole, and then bam... I'm dealing with a difficult employee at work and I'm needing to take action against him. The stress and guilt that come with it are just setting me back. My emotions feel out of whack again, and I feel myself getting pulled back under the cloud even if I'm not quite there yet.\n\nI'm also considering freezing my eggs soon, and that will also put me on a huge emotional roller coaster. I live alone and work from home so that definitely can get me down sometimes, but I'm putting a ton of work into getting out and being with people even when my body just doesn't want to leave the couch. But when the big stuff happens, it's just hard to have hope that it'll be a one-off. I feel like I'm living in fear of being pulled back under the cloud again, so I force myself to get out and do things to distract myself, and then I get burnt out.\n\nI guess I just haven't really tackled how to deal with hurdles in life with depression... I'm only now just learning how to manage the day-to-day and I hope one day I can learn to deal with the big things as they come and not be afraid that I'll get dragged back down again for the long haul.",

    "selftext": "\n**Hi everyone, I’m Pouria, and I’m 26. I’ve been battling depression since I was 16, but it’s never been this bad before. I feel like I’m at my breaking point, and I need some advice.**\n\nI studied in the UK and managed to complete my education despite enduring some of the darkest times in my life. While I was a student, I experienced an unimaginable loss—my entire family passed away back home in just one week. My mother and grandmother both passed within days of each other, and I had already lost my father five years earlier. I’m an only child, so the grief was unbearable.  \n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, after my mother’s death, my estranged uncles took advantage of me. They broke into my family home and took my savings and other important belongings. Where I’m from, inheritance laws meant that when my grandmother outlived my mother by just a few days, a portion of my mother’s belongings legally went to my uncles. I had to fight to keep my family home, and to pay them off, I worked myself to exhaustion in the UK—sometimes putting in 120-hour work weeks.  \n\nThe stress nearly broke me. I lost weight, my hair fell out, and I started having severe chest pain that felt like it was killing me. I fell into a deep depression. The only thing that kept me functioning was work because it distracted me from everything. I eventually saved enough money to return to my home country and sort things out, but since then, my depression has only gotten worse.  \n\nNow, I don’t do anything. I can’t even manage basic tasks like showering. I spend most of my days lying in the dark, praying for my life to end. The only relief I feel is when I’m asleep, but even then, I overthink in my dreams. I barely eat anymore—sometimes I go 3–4 days without eating because I don’t feel hungry, and other times I’m starving for days. But eating has become painful too—I feel regret and shame every time I eat, so I’d rather stay hungry.  \n\nI’ve isolated myself completely because even the simplest interactions feel like too much. I just scroll on my phone all day because if I don’t, I start crying uncontrollably or pacing around the house with overwhelming stress and anxiety.  \n\nI wasn’t always like this. I used to love gaming—I was even a professional gamer—but I haven’t touched my console in over seven months. I feel like I’ve lost everything—my family, my money, and my future. I keep blaming myself for my mother’s death, even though she was proud of me for pursuing my dreams and it was her decision to send me abroad. Still, I can’t shake the guilt.  I used to go the gym alot i was in really good shape , tried to go back to gym but all i was doing in a gym siting in a corner and overthinking!!!\n\nI’ve hit rock bottom. I feel like my life has no meaning, and I’ve started thinking about ending it all. I attempted suicide once when I was 17, and though it wasn’t successful, the thoughts have returned and feel stronger now.  \n\nI’m sorry for such a long post, but I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m getting worse every day, and I don’t even have the will to get better. I just want the pain to stop.  \n\nIf anyone has any advice or words of support, I’d really appreciate it.  \n\n.\n",

    "selftext": "I am an introvert kid. Not much talkative. My purpose of writing g this is to seek opinion from y’all \n\nAnyways so there’s a kid that I befriend since grade 1. Let’s call him Ben. He is very old and a helpful, trustworthy friend. But like we never were that “homie” type of friend, we still talk in a bit formal way. We used to be each other only’s friend for 3 years until grade 4 where he changed his behaviour. So he usually gets bored of me every grade. He was a social guy so he always look for kids like him, and he found plenty of them. When he found one, he will hangout with him a lot and would talk very little with me. It is also important to know that he also doesn’t talk much with me. In fact I initiate the conversation. So because of that I would feel left out, I also befriended those kids but they would usually hangout more with Ben.\n\nNow because of that in recent years I started to talk and tried to befriend other kids, cuz Ben was really my only friend. I would go to these kids group and talk with them. They would reply but only when I would talk to them. If I talk with none of the kids then I am sure they wouldn’t give a shit and forget about me. \n\nI sometimes think that Ben is really bored of me. He usually says that I am boring and he try’s to talk or play with me to his friends, which is totally false. It is usually me starts the conversation, and he would only reply. In past 4 years, each year he would befriend a new kid and literally become addicted with him, and then he would usually get bored of him, or have fight with him, or move to another school. Which results in leaving him, and then he then spend time with his backup friend (which is me) normally.\n\nVery recently in grade 9, his behaviour changed drastically. He is in his phase where he gets far away from his friend. I expected this as usual but the weird thing is, he isn’t talking to me either. Like when me,  Ben and his friend would hang out, he wouldn’t talk but rather read his book, me and the other friend would talk only. Also to mention is that is that this new friend he made is extremely annoying, so whenever ben and friend would talk, it would be because of argument. Because of Ben dry behaviour, his friend stop hanging out with us and hanged out with other kids. So now we would like be near each other but wouldn’t talk. Like it so weird, people would not even know we were friends, that day was extremely boring. The next day  he stopped hanging out with me and hanged out with other kids. So I also did the same, I hanged out with another friend group, where like they didn’t mind me being with them but they also dgaf. So now for like 3 days I am extremely lonely and bored AF. I am feeling as if Ben and mine friendship is slowly fading away. \n\nSo what y’all say? Am I lonely?",

    "selftext": "I'm having a big existential crisis about why no one loves me, why do I see couples everywhere but not me. Why is every girl I'm interested in already taken. Am I this much of a failure. Why do I have so many gifts yet can't use them. Why do people not like my uniqueness. How will I ever be able to live a fulfilling life with BPD and a mind that decides to do whatever it wants and the worst discipline you'll ever see to the point that doing 5 mins of work already drives me crazy.\n\nYou can basically divide this into 2 categories.\n1. Romantic existential crisis \n2. Ability to make something out of my life existential crisis. \n\nWhen I talk to people about these problems, they usually try to reassure me with what I consider shallow advice or consolation. Things like \"of course there's someone out there who'll love you\", \"you're an amazing person full of potential, you're stronger than you think\". Etc. In all those cases I just cannot believe whatever they say, for a simple reason... Where's the proof? Someone loves me out there? Where's the proof? I will be able to one day control my bpd to live a fulfilling life? Where's the proof. \n\nIf the proof doesn't exist or is really hard to find at the start of the process, sure... What's the plan then? Blindly follow vague advice that will at least not hurt (things like being active, taking care of yourself, etc. It might not give me a gf or allow me to finish high school, but it certainly can't hurt). Or do I flip a switch on my mind to stop pursuing getting a gf or trying to live a normal life until the day that I do find the proof that I can do either of those things. (For more specifics, this would mean, convincing myself that I want to stay single for the rest of my life, that would also mean giving up my studies and going all in on another riskier path. I can def afford to take that riskier path since I have my parents' support and a part time job on the side). \n\nAnyone has answers to this very specific concept and problem I'm talking about?",

I would be okay with not being genuine if the trade off was that people liked me, but my approach doesn't even work the way I want it to. It's hard to even know what I'm doing wrong, because the only evaluation tool I have is my own brain, and it's the problem. \n\nI feel like no one really understands me or has empathy for me. I'm close with my family but I feel if I admit how much I'm struggling they'll worry or blame my boyfriend. If I tell my boyfriend he'll feel bad himself. We're having a rough patch right now anyway so it's not really an option. What would I even say? He says his biggest goal in life is to be happy, so if I make him unhappy with what I'm feeling, he'll want to leave me. \n\nI just want someone to be nice to me.

I reassured her that I wasn’t going anywhere, I just needed to know what was going on for my own sanity, and that’s when she admitted she was really struggling. \n\nShe said she feels really bored of everything, wherever she goes or whatever she does, she is bored and just not enjoying life. Simple things such as deciding what to watch on telly or picking what’s for dinner irritates her. Sometimes she’ll go to work, come home and just hides in the bedroom and we spend an hour, if that, together of an evening before she says she’s going to sleep, like really early in the evening, so I end up spending evenings alone downstairs or lately her thing is popping to the pub after work for something to do and end up sniffing the devils dandruff, which she admits she does just to feel something knowing it’ll make her feel even more shit and also means she stays out longer each night leaving me at home alone. This is becoming more of a common thing which is worrying. \n\nI have spoken to her and said I’m not making it about my feelings but it’s hard for me to be so loved so much by someone to then feeling like they can’t even be in the same room as you, even though it’s unintentional that she’s pushing me away. She has told me she wants help and agrees life can be really boring sometimes and it won’t always be that way, yet she is still choosing to ignore that she needs help. I’ve offered to help her speak to the doctor, to reach out to other places, and to try new things together but she says she’ll do it herself and then doesn’t. \n\nI love her very much and leaving her is not an option. I don’t give up on people easy but I am really stuck on what else I can do to help her so any advice would be appreciated 🙏🏻\n",

This is nothing new to me, I was in and out of treatment from the time I was 11 until I was 18, and I haven't been in inpatient treatment since then. I graduated college last May and although extremely stressful, I was living with my best friends (which are the closest people I've ever connected to in my life) and I have always loved school. When I was 18 I studied abroad and was forced to go off of my depression medication, which ultimately ended up fine, I hadn't had a depressive episode after being off of them. And my experience studying abroad was incredible, it was the best experience I have ever had in my life and extremely freeing. \n\nSince then I had been dreaming of moving abroad and traveling, so when I graduated I decided I was going to move to Spain to teach for the year. So here I am, teaching in Spain. I know it is a huge privilege and that is why I am so mad at myself because ever since I graduated I started to feel lost (originally I thought it was because of the job I was working over the summer, it just felt really unfulfilling, but I knew I was going to be moving abroad in September so I stuck it out). But then when I moved here, my feelings only got worse. I started to cry every day, and I felt so much guilt for feeling like this because it has been all I've ever wanted and I'm disappointed in myself and feel like I should be more grateful for this opportunity. So I decided to try and stay, at least until the winter break. I thought I would eventually adjust to living here, but over the past few months I've stopped crying every day, but I've withdrawn from everyone. \n\nTo note, originally, after I got off my antidepressants I noticed that I became more of an extrovert, loved going out and meeting new people, trying new things, having interesting conversations, and ultimately hated being alone. Now I say no to going out, it's hard for me to get out of bed, I get angry or cry at the slightest inconvenience, and I want to be around someone who knows me and understands me, someone I can just sit with and not have to speak to. But I started thinking last night, \"When was the last time I spoke to someone\" like we had a conversation. And I could only think of 2 times since I've been here where I felt like I connected with someone. But the idea of going out and talking to someone at all makes me feel like I need a nap. Not only this feeling that everything is overwhelming, but I've also struggled with an eating disorder since I was around 11 as well, and since being here I have felt completely out of control with the amount of food I eat, which could also be a reason I feel unable to socialize with others. \n\nThe constant thoughts about the fact that I've gained weight, and how much I hate myself and am bad at my job just weighs so heavily on my mind and they never go away. At this point, I'm just ranting, but another thing is that my boss at the school I work for is so extraverted and all over the place, she is constantly running around and never has time to listen to me when I need help, but every Thursday we meet for 10 minutes to discuss my progress in the classes I work in, and every Thursday she tells me I need to be more energetic, outgoing, and excited to work with the students, oh and that I'm basically a horrible teacher (although not the exact words, she pretty much says everything I do isn't enough and I need to be doing better), and when I feel what I'm doing in class is enough, she comes and tells me its not and the teacher didn't think whatever I was doing was good. \n\nI just feel like I'm 1. not good at my job which I'm trying really hard to do despite the fact I have no motivation, 2. am fat and lazy and how the hell could I let myself go the way I did, 3. a burden to everyone around me especially my mom who won't even pick up the phone anymore cause I'm always crying when I call her, and 4. that I should just stay away from everyone and be quiet because I don't want to bring anyone down and should just be grateful cause I'm in Spain, and how could I not feel happy when I've gotten everything I've ever wanted. I don't know what to do, I don't know if going home would make me feel better or if I should just try to survive until June. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my rant, and I hope that even if no one has any advice that if someone has experienced something similar, it would be nice to feel like at least I'm not the only one here.

And I could only think of 2 times since I've been here where I felt like I connected with someone. But the idea of going out and talking to someone at all makes me feel like I need a nap. Not only this feeling that everything is overwhelming, but I've also struggled with an eating disorder since I was around 11 as well, and since being here I have felt completely out of control with the amount of food I eat, which could also be a reason I feel unable to socialize with others. \n\nThe constant thoughts about the fact that I've gained weight, and how much I hate myself and am bad at my job just weighs so heavily on my mind and they never go away. At this point, I'm just ranting, but another thing is that my boss at the school I work for is so extraverted and all over the place, she is constantly running around and never has time to listen to me when I need help, but every Thursday we meet for 10 minutes to discuss my progress in the classes I work in, and every Thursday she tells me I need to be more energetic, outgoing, and excited to work with the students, oh and that I'm basically a horrible teacher (although not the exact words, she pretty much says everything I do isn't enough and I need to be doing better), and when I feel what I'm doing in class is enough, she comes and tells me its not and the teacher didn't think whatever I was doing was good. \n\nI just feel like I'm 1. not good at my job which I'm trying really hard to do despite the fact I have no motivation, 2. am fat and lazy and how the hell could I let myself go the way I did, 3. a burden to everyone around me especially my mom who won't even pick up the phone anymore cause I'm always crying when I call her, and 4. that I should just stay away from everyone and be quiet because I don't want to bring anyone down and should just be grateful cause I'm in Spain, and how could I not feel happy when I've gotten everything I've ever wanted. I don't know what to do, I don't know if going home would make me feel better or if I should just try to survive until June. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my rant, and I hope that even if no one has any advice that if someone has experienced something similar, it would be nice to feel like at least I'm not the only one here.

We‘ve been together for almost 2 years now, in the beginning she was trying to hide her depression but the closer we‘ve gotten the more she opened up to me. The past 2-3 months were by far the worst of our relationship. She sleeps for literally 16-20 hours EVERY day, doesnt wanna go out, doesnt wanna do anything and also doesnt wanna talk. Luckily i know about her depression but its getting serious on my end too cause i dont know how to handle all of this. I feel like she doesnt wanna see or talk to me, but i love her and wanna be the best boyfriend and place where she feels safe. Its hard for me too because she gets mad at me or stays at my place just to leave after 10 minutes because she doesnt want anyone around her. Do you guys have any tips on how to handle this situation?\n\nEdit: She is already visting a therapist and psychiatrist and is soon going to a dayclinic for psychiatry where she will stay for like 3 months ",

    "selftext": "My (23M) partner (26F) of 2 years is kind, loving and a good-hearted person, but there are some core \"differences\" in our personalities due to circumstances, and I am having a hard time navigating these and am a bit concerned for our future. We're both STEM majors, and I have always throughout my life been very much a \"type-A\" personality (ambitious, taking school and work seriously, and can unfortunately be impatient with others I care about and perceive as lazy). She seemed to be similar in her valuing education and \"taking life seriously\", which I, naturally, found attractive. As time went on, however, parts of her personality and history was revealed to me. Due to various events in her life she had become depressed, and was struggling in school.\n\nNow, roughly two years later, she is doing better health-wise, having gone on medication and doing therapy. She has not been taking grad school classes in a while to solely focus on finishing her undergraduate thesis, a choice I fully support, but this has been going on for at least six months and she has not progressed too much from what I understand. Discussing this is difficult for us both, as I tend to have a hard time understanding depression and sometimes feel like she does not put in enough effort, while she gets super defensive about any criticism. Usually, these conversations end up with her crying and me comforting her and apologizing for coming off too harsh.\n\nShe has been expressing desires to move in together, and taking the relationship more seriously (as she's also a bit older). While I understand this, and enjoy her as a partner in many ways, I can't shake off my feelings of doubt. If we already have established this kind of dynamic where I feel like she should work harder to finish her school while myself being quite busy, and she sometimes feeling like I don't put enough effort in the relationship due to my priorities being elsewhere, how will things turn out once \"real life problems\" enter the picture? finances, kids, et.c. ?\n\nI am looking for any advice or others' personal experiences.

I can’t tell my family that my home is so messy that it’s making me want to die. I can’t tell them that I’ve got really shitty self hating thoughts on a loop. \n\nI was kind of hoping that somebody out there feels the same - I think it would help to tell someone when it’s bad. Ideally looking for a person/people with similar struggles so we can check in, motivate each other, and kind of hold each other accountable to small reachable goals. Being online and not knowing each other in person, plus being in the same position, there’s less shame in being honest. Nothing heavy or overly personal, and no wallowing in it together or taking it off Reddit - just like “have you eaten today?”, “I’m feeling really rubbish”, blah blah. Then we might be able to say “right let’s both get up and make some food”. No weirdness.\n\nI don’t know if it’s a shitty idea, but I just can’t keep going on like this. I need to get better it’s ruining my life. Maybe we can help each other if you want to get better but are struggling to stay on track too. Surely there is someone out there who would benefit from that? Leave a comment if so please.

I used to love writing. I used to want to get better. I used to like playing video games and making YouTube content but I just can’t do it anymore. Everytime I’ve tried to revive my passion for my hobbies I just give up a day in. I don’t want to go to school, I don’t want to go to college, I don’t want to lose weight or practice self care, I don’t want to get a job or be productive or talk to my friends. I just want to give up. \n\nI have a therapist and a psychiatrist and I’m on antidepressants but I don’t know. I thought about calling a helpline last night but I was scared. I reached out to my mother for the first time and she told me I needed to want to change. I don’t want to. I’m sorry if this is repetitive I’m just so exauhsted. I’ve tried being happy but more than anything I hope I don’t wake up tomorrow. I don’t want to do anything ever again. I know people care about me and I know people’s worlds would be shattered if I died but I don’t want to live for other people. I want to find passion. I want a best friend again. I miss my best friend. Sorry. I just needed a place to vent without worrying about someone I know seeing it and adamantly trying to figure out what’s wrong because I don’t know anymore. Please help me. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live anymore either.",

I realised this problem when I started high school and I've always wanted to tell someone but no one to tell. \n\nJust to note I can be affected by negative words and actions severely.\n\nI've always loved my parents. But not in some cases where my anger issues and irritability started to lash out. \n\nWhenever my parents:\n\n\\- kept on repeating the stuff that I should done when I was already doing it.\n\n\\- kept on repeating the stuff I should not do when I did not do it.\n\n\\- saying terrible things about me where these strong negative wordings will repeat in my head 10 or more times and make me even angrier and sadder.\n\n\\- saying do not want to see \"Minecraft\" and \"Dragon\" pictures as she said these are the \"ghost/curse/I am exorcised\", made me shitty ass want to break stuff.\n\n\\- saying no makes me very irritated.\n\n\\- banning me from drawing dragons or blocks or Minecraft stuff makes me really really frustrated! (they thought drawing blocks was Minecraft when I am not, my strengths in drawing are 3D objects.)\n\n\\- banning me from writing fantasy-related stories and fanfics cannot improve my concentration!!! (I have a really big issue with imagining 3D animated stories before sleep while doing homework and taking a shower FOR NO REASON!!!!! I most of the time get insomnia because of that)\n\nEven worse! When I started crying or lashing out and yelling at them, they would start to have a scolding battle with me. If I cry, they will scold me but not comfort me (That was what I promised to do the opposite if I became a mum); If I lash out (ie. break stuff and furiously pull and push stuff), they will scold me, swear at me, and saying negative words (\"You should go to a mental hospital because only people with mental illness yells.\") and ignore me completely like the entire few days; If I yelled at them, they will scold me and say the same thing. It actually EEEEEEEE psychologically hurts me and I cannot rebut it because I am not very good at rebutting, however, even though I did it, they won't listen to me. (They'll say \"I don't care I don't care I don't want to listen\")\n\nShe dropped a towel in front of me today and I yelled at her because she said she doesn’t want to see Minecraft videos when she told me to close all YouTube related tabs but it is a music video from the Songs Of War (I loved this movie but my parents banned it because it is Minecraft). She scolded me because she thought I was thinking of that, so she ignored me for the entire day.\n\nI never swear or speak foul language in my life. But sometimes there are things I cannot express my sadness with. I have to I'm sorry.",

    "selftext": "If anyone can give me some insight or some advice that’d be great because I feel so hopeless lost and just all the above. The thing that’s been sitting on my chest heavily swinging back and forth I can feel that shit so heavily. I got into an argument with this girl who was my friend but we had a pretty long history, romantic in nature but we both just fucked up. Needless to say this isn’t the first argument we had, but it’s kinda always about the same thing. She could never be what I at some point longed for, a relationship and I could never accept the rejection that came after everything. A lot of mixed signals and when things were clear I realized alot of the initial hurt she caused me still lingered and I felt like I imposed a lot of my feelings I felt on her because I thought we could be friends but yk trauma and history I got insecure and I felt like a friendship with her, I’d never matter or it didn’t feel enough for me because we use to have that romantic connection and a friendship in one. Mind you this girl (23) she suffers from addiction and basically a lot of trauma she didn’t deserve to endure. So was I selfish to expect more? I just feel like I had been lead on for maybe 1 year and we both though a friendship would work, I thought it could but alas I lied to myself and I guess in turn it was a lie to her, not one I made viciously, I just really wanted her to be apart of my life somehow even if it couldn’t be romantic. But she’s made questionable choices through it all sometimes dismissing my feelings or just being an inconsiderate asshole, I’ve been understanding and forgiving through it all but our last conversation left a sour taste in my mouth because I wish I was able to understand her pain and what’s she’s going through/her addiction better, just as I wish she understood my hurt a little more. I still have so much love for her as a person because I respected her and that was my dawgg:/ just the hurt and betrayal of it all, because she was very on/off with me and I guess she hoped that distancing herself when she needed it would help me get over it or that she wouldn’t give me anymore mixed signals. I think it just broke me more, I felt abandoned by her and shit like this just resurfaces old wounds, of never being first choice to anyone. I lose everyone I ever care about but it seems for some reason with her I feel this is my fault because I couldn’t agree to just friends and I felt selfish, im not saying I was expecting a relationship from her but having a friendship with her reoccurring circumstances and toxic ties she had that I really felt hurt by, it was just all so painful. Why do I cause so much trouble for those I care about. Why do people even bother caring about me. I don’t feel good enough for anyone anymore. Yet I feel I have an obligation to be alive for my mom n other ppl. Worst of all I just have so much worry and anxiety that she might accidentally od or just being so worried and I know it’s not my place but I really care about her despite everything and I just wanted to show her that she deserves so much good even if she was shitty to me but I’d be lying if I said we didn’t have moments that I will forever cherish. A part of me wishes that I had never met her because I feel like maybe she wouldn’t endure this painful whirlwind of turmoil , just maybe she would have one less problem to worry about. I’m tired of being a burden. I feel like im reaching a breaking point. I’m almost 22 but it feels like I’ve lived and died emotionally so many times. I don’t think I’ve ever been able to make anyone happy let alone myself. I hate that I can never make any good choices and I fear I hurt people just as much as they hurt me. I’m just tired of living.

I wish people understood how much it means to a lonely person to get a call asking them if they’re ok and if they want to go for a walk. Or just talk. I honestly don’t mean to be a bad person I’m just bad at making choices and I was just so addicted. I tried to get help at the hospital but they said that you can’t go to detox or any inpatient for the drug I was doing. I feel terrible and lonely. My sister said I’m freeloading off of my mother who is schizophrenic but I don’t mean to. I help pay rent when I can hold a job and I was just homeless. I’m just trying to get stable. I wish people just understood that I don’t have to come over just a call means so much to me. My other sister texted me a year ago from last Christmas and she just stopped texting in the middle of our conversation. I haven’t heard from her since but I think she tells my other sister to stay away from me. They both say that the good experiences with me don’t out weigh the bad.

I am a failure, my parents know this too. If anyone should it's them. Why am I sitting here talking about being a failure and doing nothing about it. I don't know.\n\nI've been like this ever since January 2nd. My birthday - I broke up with my s/o - they didn't take it well. Now all of my friends are gone. Six years of laughter, six years of being friends gone. It's all gone. I knew something awful was going to happen. I called it. It's hard for me to make new friends. Even if I did it wouldn't be the same. Six years of laughter wasted. It's all my fault too. That's what I get for dating my best friend. Maybe it wasn't as real to them as it was for me.\n\nIf we were still friends, I'd show them this game I'd found. No Big Deal, on Roblox. I'd tell them how fun it is, and we'd play together. I'd show them the YouTube video that led me to finding it. We'd pack a bowl and smoke, it'd be so wonderful. I think we'd both get into character, pretending to be Wall Street goons. It'd be fun. We would laugh. We should be laughing together right now. I should be texting them about it right now. Instead I'm typing this. What's this gonna do? Maybe someone will tell me I'll be alright. I will. I know I will.\n\nI knew our friendship would end like that, too. I knew it. I came up with the scenario in my head. I do that a lot.\n\nI just want it to end. I don't want to die. I just need it to stop. What would I even do if I went to school. I'd be so lost I'd barely understand a thing. I'd be lost, and be put in bad standing with the teacher. They'd hate helping me, they always do. I could tell in the last one, the exasperated sighs whenever I'd ask for help. It'd only be me too. What's so different about me.\n\nI don't want to love anymore. I don't want to cry anymore. I don't want to smile anymore. I don't want to be angry anymore. I don't want to be happy anymore. But I know I will. Because I'm gullible, a failure, a mistake, an idiot.\n\nThis post is too long. If people see it they won't read it. Maybe that's for the better. ",

    "selftext": "For my entire life I've struggled with self-esteem and self-doubt. I always imagined being a different person who felt belonged with friends, connected with family, fulfilled with work, and who could feel and share love with my partner. Each time I've had these feelings within reach, whether within me or shared from others, my mind tells me I'm not worthy, I'm not capable, and I'm not good enough to have those feelings. I used to have the structure of work and school to distract myself but every time I would lay on my bed late at night when it was dark and quiet, those thoughts would ruminate. I would ever tire myself to sleep or cry myself to sleep. Similarly at this time I would often imagine scenarios where these feelings were true, and I would iterate them until they felt real. I had battled these thoughts for so long that I was too exhausted to fight back, I laid down and started to believe them.\n\nThis led to my depression. It ruined my relationship with my soulmate, the only person I had opened up to, my biggest supporter, my twin flame. I have always struggled to express myself. I would think over and over the romantic dates, presents, and conversations we could have but I couldn't act upon them. I had always wanted to be that person to openly communicate and to feel and share big emotions. This is the person she has said she needed for the relationship to work and now believes we are fundamentally different people. But I can't accept this because deep down I have always wanted to be that person way before I met her. I feel it is one of the reasons I consider her my soulmate. We broke up a few days ago. It ruined my performance and passion for my job. I just started a long leave period. The two most important aspects of my life gone. When I got home from the breakup talk, I sat for a while, exhausted from all the crying and rumination of the past few weeks when we took a short break. I tried to hang myself. I felt and thought nothing in the lead up, it was as if someone controlled me. I couldn’t go through with it, once I took the noose off, I broke down crying, shouting how much more suffering do I need to experience to push me off the edge. The past few weeks, I’ve uncontrollably constantly asked myself how I’ve been feeling, and I repeat the same conversations to myself. I’m just exhausted. I want it to stop.",

She was telling me she doesn't want to do this anymore, etc. L can't swallow tablets too. Which is another thing holding her back but she says that she doesn't know how long these things will keep putting her off anymore.\n\nAs her boyfriend I have no idea what to do in this situation. I have spent every second of the past few months letting her know that I'll listen to her, I'm here for her and I will do whatever I can to help with this but I am still petrified that I'm going to lose her.

Then she had an operation which required her to stay off work for 3 weeks and she realised that the job isn't the issue and she felt the same. L says that the last time she felt happy was before she took her recent promotion with her job but she doesn't think stepping down will help her as she'll be less distracted.\n\nShe has tried therapy and didn't find it helpful and is skeptical of it. She believes medication might help and I am holding onto anti depressants for her (that she has to chew to be able to take). \n\nShe currently lives with her Mum but her Mum travels all the time and isn't home often. So she hates coming home to the house because she feels lonely.\n\nOne of the only things giving me home is that a week ago I made her look me in the eye and promise that she won't kill herself. I don't know if this should give me hope though.\n\nI'm here looking for some hope. I guess some advice? I love her and I can't stand the thought of losing her. I want to make her happy and I want to show her that the world isn't all darkness. How do I do that?\n\nPlease feel free to ask me anything that would help. Thank you.",

I dont feel like i can function as an adult and been feeling like i need help for ages. \n\nBut i live in a postsoviet country where mental health is a taboo and when ive said it to someone i was mostly told it sucks or i should work more to think less. Ive looked into many options. Ive looked into therapy locally and it was sparse and expensive. Ive also moved to countryside since and stopped working so theres even less options here if any. Ive read selfhelp books and downloaded some apps to help me function but nothing ever helps much. Ive tried searching for online therapy but as far as ive looked ive only seen options from US and they are even more expensive. And honestly i feel like i dont deserve to spend money on myself when i have family. Even more so now since i dont have my own income.\n\nI dont really have friends and im on a brink of breakup with my husband. I dont see the light at the end of the tunnel. And the worst thing is i dont want to pass this all onto my daughter. \n\nI would love to hear of ANY resources that could help me. Hang in there people❤️",

(27 now). I can say with certainty it did absolutely nothing. I ended up stopping it because i was dead broke, and im like, why am i paying you 70 a week to basically just vent? Im trying to find different types of therapy outside of CBT, but its like \"this is 200 a session with insurance!\"\n\nIm on round #5 of medication roulette. The only things that help even slightly are SSRIs or the SSRI cousin, i cant remember the name. Wow thats great, isnt it? No. I gained 100 lbs and have yo-yo'ed ever since. Im still 70 lbs from where i was before, when i finally looked skinny and pretty for the first time in my life. Ive always hated myself for my weight and now nothing fits, i look horrible because all i can afford is whatever random garbage is on the plus-size clearance rack, and im a fat ugly lard that looks like a stuffed sausage in anything i wear. That surely helps my already destroyed self-esteem. My doctor wants me to try those weight-loss medicines but i cant afford them.\n\nIm in so much mental and physical pain i have to sit in a chair in front of the stove to cook. Eating is really hard for me now. Ive been skipping meals. I just cant do it.\n\nI was switched off the latesr SSRI and put on trazodone, and its only been a week, but i am absolutely miserable. I cried 3 times today. Im extremely irritable, i have basically no memory and no focus, plus i still have brain zaps. I literally can barely do the stuff i have to do at work.\n\nI am literally verbally screaming to my husband and my family that I NEED HELP. But in reality, theres absolutely nothing anyone can do. The only thing that would help would be a small fortune to move out of this city and apartment i HATE and to get me all the treatments and medicines i need. But sadly, that isnt a reality. And so i schlep myself to work every day, crying on the bus, crying quietly at my desk, cry on the way home, and then numb my brain with video games or sleeping the evening away. I cant do it anymore but what choice do i have? There is no other choice. My life has been cursed from the day i was born and it will be cursed until the day i die.\n\nI am extremely pain avoidant and so i cant hurt myself. But i wish i could.

I would say that we know each other very well and have a good grasp on how to help or even just provide support to each other during hard times. For a while now, my boyfriend has been depressed and is constantly up and down with his emotions (I hope that doesn't come off as rude). I hate to see him hurting and appreciate when he is vulnerable with me, which isn't often because he still struggles with the whole idea that men can hurt too and it doesn't make them less manly to express those feelings. I myself have had depression for a while (I have been doing good for the past few months), but my experience and what I need is very different than his. Just to put this out there, he never directs any of his pent up aggression or hurt feelings at me. Every time I can feel him having a depressive episode (his tone and demeanor changes) I make sure to give him a bit of space, but I eventually ask if hes upset, if hes okay, and if he wants to talk about it. Almost everytime he does, and he says around the same thing; \"I am always depressed, anxious and everything feels horrible. Nothing makes me feel better. I just want to sleep.\" I am very concerned about him, and yes hes seeing professional help and has shown some improvement. I just don't know what to say. I know it isn't on me to fix his problems, but what can I do? I hate to see him suffering. I don't want to pry too much because he might become quiet and repetitive (usually this means hes checked out) but I don't want to be leaving it alone in fear that I wasn't there when he needed me.

It's a dreadful feeling, a feeling of hopelessness.      \n\nI like to imagine a life without these problems but when I do it only ever reminds me that such a life is something I have never known. I have never experienced a life that is \"normal.\" When I imagine a life where I can speak normally, learn normally, create the things I wish to create without being in physical pain, I feel two emotions which dance together yet are on opposite ends of the spectrum. As hopeless and broken as I feel, I also feel something burning inside me and it burns so vividly that the thought of things being better is what keeps me going through it all. When I think of what life can be, I feel like all the pain I go through will one day be only a bad memory and I will finally be happy.   \n\nBut then I'm reminded that the life I've lived, memory or not, happened and really I've had about a third of my life already taken from me.

The small group of friends I used to have have moved on with their lives, started careers and started families. They don't talk to me anymore. Wasn't even invited to their weddings. I've been forgotten. Both my brothers sexually abused me as a child and my parents would rather just brush it under the rug than deal with it. I love my parents but I can't even go to their house (my childhood home) because my brother lives there with no signs of moving out. I have a wife and I love her but our marriage has been falling apart for years now. I'm a shell of who I used to be. I don't do any of the things that I enjoy doing anymore. Why? I don't know I just don't. Instead I just spend my time sleeping, eating and staring at my phone screen for hours at a time. I've gained 40+ lbs in the last couple of years because I switched from coping with drugs to coping with food. I've always been insecure about my appearance but now it's exponentially worse as I have grown what looks like a beer belly. Clothes don't fit anymore and I've gone from a medium to an extra large. XXL coming soon. I still do the drugs they just don't do it for me all the way anymore. I've tried sobriety but I can't bear facing the world without a crutch. The only way I see to end the suffering is to end my life. It will probably hurt a few people pretty badly but they will get over it and move on with their lives.

    "selftext": "TLDR: I have been lucky throughout my academic life. But I have never had any truly lasting friendships and think I am insignificant in everyone's lives. All of it is crashing down on me right now.\n\nI am dumping my thoughts without editing for clarity or word length. This has been a recurring feeling throughout my life, but the last couple of months have made it measurably worse.\n\nI come from a fairly middle-class family. My parents have been the best parents I could've asked for and provided me with all that I could've ever asked for throughout my childhood despite their means. They have also supported me — financially and otherwise — throughout my school and undergrad education and never asked for anything from my side. My sister is the cutest and most loving little girl. So, my family doesn't have anything to do with this rigmarole I'm typing.\n\nI (somehow) got into one of the best colleges in my country and a major that I liked (but not my natural first choice). To this day, I consider it a fluke (Fluke #1). My academic performance throughout the course was okay at best. I'd always wanted to transition to another major (the one I didn't get to do in my undergrad) and liked research, so I applied to graduate programs. I was terribly unconfident with my chances, as I was coming from a major with minimal overlap, and while I did have a relevant internship, nothing else in my resume could be considered \"good\" for a graduate applicant. As expected, most of the decisions I got back were rejections. Just when I'd given up hope, I (somehow, again) got and accepted an offer from one of the best colleges in the world for this major. This was Fluke #2.\n\nAll this to say, my academic life has been a set of flukes. I do realize this statement comes off as me taking it all for granted, but I am not. I'm very grateful for the opportunities I've been given. It's just that, because of all this, I have had imposter syndrome on steroids for the last 6-odd years. And I cannot let it go.\n\nMoving along. I have always been an introverted person. In my childhood, I moved around quite a bit, so I never lived in the same city for too long. As a result, I couldn't make any close friends. I was considered an \"outsider\" at every school I went to despite trying my best to fit in, as I would always be associated with being from another part of my country. I did make a few friends here and there, none of them close, but I am not in touch with any of them anymore. During my undergrad, I was \"adopted by\" some friends who I am still in touch with (kinda), but all of us have diverged in our paths. Most of them are still in my country, so they meet and hang out with each other even now while I am continents away. I feel (and believe with good reason) that they are closer to each other and other people than they are to me. It's valid, given the distance and the fact that I am not very outgoing. I don't think too much of it.\n\nI have made friends in grad school as well, and they have been some of the most enriching friendships that I have had. By trying to be more outgoing, I connected with a lot more people and made friends with a good number of them. While I do consider a few of them close, I still feel nobody would think of me as a close friend. My roommate is the best roommate I could've asked for, and to me, they are as close to family as it gets here. But I am not sure they would feel the same about me. And now, most of these people will be moving to other places, so I fear these friendships will end up like the ones I made during my undergrad.\n\nSo, really, I think I am a bystander in all of my friends' lives, despite all of them being main characters in my life. I make efforts to interact with all of them to the best of my (introverted) capacity, but ultimately, my life has been a recurring series of people entering, me getting close to them, and them leaving... While I still remain attached to them.\n\nI've never been a goal-oriented person, nor have I had any thoughts about how I want my future to pan out, for a long time. The last time was when I was sure about the field I wanted to work in. I see my friends, and everyone has dreams for the future and has things \"sorted\" for themselves, in the short-term if not long-term. I feel really happy for them all, but resent them at the same time, because I don't see myself going anywhere.\n\nUntil now, I used to \"latch onto\" a few people. During my childhood, it was family. During my undergrad, it was my family and those few friends. In grad school, it has been my roommate and my other new friends. But now that I know for a fact I won't have any of those around me in my short-term future, I have stopped living for myself. I have lost all motivation to do anything. I never want to work on my academics. I have stopped stepping foot outside my room and skip food very frequently. I really don't know if I will be able to survive for much longer like this.\n\nI have considered ending it a few times. I thought I was in worse mental shape at this time last year, but I have (somehow) dug myself — and fallen into — a deeper hole. This has been the story every passing year, and I have gotten tired of it. I think this is all too much to bear any longer. It feels like that would be alright because nobody apart from my family really considers me a significant part of their lives. Plus, what am I really doing in life besides just existing?\n\nI know I am only 25 and \"my life is only getting started\" and I have a shit ton more to see and experience. I know I need therapy. I cannot bring myself to go. I have hobbies, but I don't feel like doing them anymore. None of them are ones where I have to interact with people. I am in touch with my family.",

My family’s in a rough spot financially, and I’ve been living in a one-bedroom apartment for about 5 years now, sleeping in the living room. I’m 18, and I’ve been helping my mom with a lot since I was 10, but it feels like I’m doing more than I should be. She’s not very educated, and her English is poor, so she can’t handle a lot of things on her own, including business-related stuff. It's just hurts even more and makes me really sad :( because I know she’s trying her best but she’s just not doing things the right way and it’s hard to watch.)\n\n^(We’re always living paycheck to paycheck. I work too, but my income barely covers anything, and I don’t think it would even be enough if I lived by myself. I make maybe around a thousand or less a month, but a lot of the time I end up having to help her with things she can’t pay for, like bills and other expenses. I’ve been planning to move out for a while, but things always get in the way, and I feel like I’m stuck back at square one. It feels like I’m running away from my problems, but I just wish to live comfortably. I don’t want to be stuck because of things I didn’t cause.)\n\n^(This year, for the first time, I’m the one doing my mom’s taxes. She’s always had a CPA before, but now it’s all on me. I don’t know what I’m doing, and it feels like a huge burden. I’ve never done taxes before, and it’s frustrating.)\n\n^(I’ve been dealing with a lot of depression for that past few years too, which makes everything harder. I’m constantly scared about the future, not knowing if I’ll ever get my life together or have a career that can bring me peace. I mess up a lot—like I’m lazy, I make mistakes constantly, and it’s like I can’t get things right. I’m terrible at school, video games, socializing, basically everything. I feel like a failure. I even went through a really depressive episode in 2023 after reading Oyasumi Punpun the ending had me up fucked up and seeing how Aiko was treated in the end made me feel like I wasn’t alone in my sadness. It’s a tiny bit better now, but I still struggle.)\n\n^(I don’t have much of a father figure. My dad’s far away, and honestly, he’s not someone I can rely on. He’s also the reason I’ve had some pretty terrible experiences in my life. Another thing to add his father sexually assaulted me when I was 14/5ish and that just made everything even more worse. I’ve always felt like the odd one out in school maybe I’m autistic, maybe I have ADHD, but I don’t really know. I’m just lost in it all.)\n\n^(I know I’m not perfect, and I’m trying, but it feels like it’s never enough. I want to move forward, but I don’t know how. I have goals, like I want to make a change in the world somehow and I want to have a future with my girlfriend, but it’s hard to see the path forward when everything is so overwhelming. Sometimes I wish I had some sort of father figure or someone to guide me.)\n\n^(I’m just feeling really stuck, and I don’t know what to do anymore. If anyone’s been through something similar, I’d really appreciate any advice or tips on how to navigate all of this.)\n\n^(Thanks for listening guys)",

I want to get back to enjoying life. I am not thinking of self harm and never had. Just need to figure out how to turn my life in the right directions.

I rather be in hellfire and see nothing in darkness than just live like this another single day. I have no wife, no children, no family, no career, no goals, no property. This is just a waste of life, I think even trash is more useful than me. Touching grass, working isn't the cure to my sadness. I did all of that for many years, forced myself to.

I went out for a walk and wandered the streets till i reached an empty yet suspicious street and it was 3 AM.

At that time, I was 15 years old and I was doing self harm so I grabbed a piece of glass and stood behind the table and started cutting my arm.

After a while I stood up and started walking again.\n\n\n What i didn't know of is that there was someone who saw me harming myself and thought that I was taking a drug injection because it was really dark and drug injections r a thing in Egypt and that guy called his friends.

    "selftext": "Hey, this is my first time writing on the thread. So bare with me if I'm horrible at explaining. It's long but I hope you guys can give me some advice.\n\n*Background story: (you can skip this part)*\n\n*Long story short, I have been with my high school sweetheart for 4 years now. We broke up once in between because we were immature and reconnected when we both realized we love each other so very much. We seemed to fix the issues we had, so it was very good.*\n\n*The problem happened when we were about to go into long distance because my job relocated to a different state; and I found out he cheated on me 2 months (from when i found out) ago. We had to go into long distance with this news. We had a couple issues from him lying to me before but nothing this big. He flew in and begged and explained everything to me and told me he would do everything to fix it.*\n\n*First month was good, but he started to get really frustrated with the guilt and not noticing any improvement on my end (although he fully understood it was his fault at the end of the day). He cheated on me at work, so every time he is at work I would freak out, fairly so, but still very frustrating situation for both of the party. Plus he was dealing with a lot of guilt (again reasonably so, but painful). He started to mention that this maybe isn't something he can't fix and he fucked up. He was losing hope. On my end, I was basically having anxiety attacks everything he didn't answer the phone, and every time we called, I would just get really upset—obviously I was taking my time accepting and healing.*\n\nHere is my question:\n\nAfter cheating on me, my boyfriend has been repeatedly saying that he doesn't deserve me, he feels more and more guilty every day, he feels like he's walking on eggshells because he doesn't want to hurt my feelings, he feels like even when he is not trying to hurt my feelings he keeps hurting me and that makes him feel horrible. He mentions his relationship with his parents isn't great (when he respects his parents the most) and that his father keeps telling him something is wrong with him. He doesn't feel like himself and he hates himself. He hates who he has become. Then starting a month ago, he said he doesn't feel anything.\n\nHe first thought he was losing feelings for me, but he realized that he was feeling the same way towards his mother who he loves the most and his father. He said something is wrong with him and he wants to understand why he is feeling this way. With all the feeling of emptiness and hatred for himself, he doesn't feel it when I even tell him I love him. He just feels like he doesn't deserve someone like me. He knows that he loves me in his head, but he doesn't feel it and therefore it is so hard for him to be affectionate towards me when he knows that is what I need. He said he has tried everything to get rid of this thought but he couldn't and started to feel like breaking up is an option worth trying as nothing else seems to work.\n\nThat being said, he asked to break up, because he needs some time alone to fix it. He always have been someone that doesn't think he needs anyone, and so he just wants to deal with this himself. He fears that he would hurt me even more if I'm around, and eventually ruin the love I have for him. He doesn't believe in therapy but he finally decided to get it (which shows how desperate he is) to have someone to talk about this. He assured me he still loves me so much and he cares about me more than anything—he just needs to deal with it himself and hopefully he can come back. It was hard because he couldn't seem to pull the trigger himself, we took days to separate for real and I finally decided to walk away for now because I believed I should do it for him. Even until the last moment, it was clear he didn't want me out of his life.\n\n**Did I do the right thing? Would he come back? What if he just lost feelings for me? I am sure he has depression, is this what he really needs?** Should I keep trying to show my support and love? I just don't know what is the best thing for him in this situation and I just want to understand better what he needs.\n\nThanks, this is really damn long but I'd really appreciate your response.",

I am here because I don't know where else to go. I'm desperate. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since my teen years. I took antidepressants for almost four years, alongside some private therapy sessions, although these were not enough because I could not afford more. However, the medication did not help at all, so I gradually stopped taking it months ago (gradually).\n\nEverything got worse when I started feeling pain almost everyday and got diagnosed with fybromialgia, for which they prescribed me opioids. Again, they do not seem to work well for me, since the pain won't go away. I had to stop working and studying because of this. Last September, I enrolled again on uni in order to try to finish my undergraduate degree. I did my best to attend most lessons, mostly because attendance was compulsory. I was not in that much pain, but since beginning of December, I have been feeling worse and worse.  \n\nI am in dark place right now. I barely can keep with hygiene, cannot cook (if it wasn't for my sister, I would have starved), cannot concentrate to study, don't see my friends (if I can call them that...), etc. Honestly, I feel like a burden and a complete failure. Even if my chronic illness is not a degenerative one, it affects me tremendously in all aspects of my life. If I am not able to work and the state won't give me financial aids, how am I supposed to pay for the most basic things? My parents won't be always there to help me. My father is almost 70 and my mother is ill too, she has a stage 4 lynfoma cancer and is currently receiving radiotherapy (she is stable tho and has overcome it for seven years now). Also, besides these circumstances, I hate being so dependant on them and our relationship has been problematic since my teen years too. \n\nI just don't see the point of living and I have not tried to end my life because of two things: I am afraid of failing and of the consequences it would have and because of how my death would affect my family and the people around me in general. \n\nThank you for reading this. I appreciate any kind of support or/and help 🙏🏻💙. \n",

But getting older is realizing that sometimes life circumstances are just the way they are and made you the way you are, i hate to play victim and up until now i had hoped that my “depression” and “anxiety” were just puberty. they sadly weren’t i’m getting help now but i’m seriously reaching my limit. during highschool i got really depressed, into drugs, tried to end it all. i was just overall dead inside. i managed to graduate yay, went to college dropped out because i got really depressed and i wasn’t passionate about what i was learning. (it’s not like i wasn’t doing the work because i was and i could have passed but my heart wasn’t in it) so yeah i took a gap year, worked, tried to figure shit out like what i want to do, tried different hobbies, it was like one of the loneliest year of my life. but i was very disciplined in everything that i did. this year is my 3 year mark of going to the gym and before that i excersized 2 years at home so yeah that’s the only thing that has been keeping me going and alive, i have a back injury now not sure why maybe because of the stress and depression but could be because of improper form? anyways if i end up not being able to go to the gym i just might aswell not be here, it truly has been the only thing that has been helping me with my depression, loneliness and anxiety. even if i did not want to i went, even though i was tired i went. i quit work a month ago, i want to change work because i want to broaden my cv etc, but fuck it feels wrong not to go to work, i used the time to focus on passing my drivers license which i did. i should be happy because on the outside everything seems okay, i found what i want to do with my life, i love graphic design, i stay active, passed my drivers license, i work, set goals for the year ykno like a mood board, i’m on the student council, but fuck do i feel lonely, it’s eating me alive. i might be traumatized by my past relationship which doesn’t hel, everything is a lot and i’m so tired of thinking about it all. when is it my time to be alive? i just don’t understand why i can’t have the strength to keep on going. why can’t i be normal? why am i never good enough, why do i always try my hardest and nothing good comes out of it? i just get more and more depressed. why can’t i be the type of person to instead of drown in their sorrow find light and become a stronger person from it. why am i such a fucking failure. i’m a bad friend i lost so many of them. because i just did not feel connected to them. even now at school i feel lonely, do i choose to feel this way? but why would i. so many questions. i know this all is written all messy but i can’t think, i can’t sleep. i can’t function properly. i have no one that i can truly talk to except my therapist. so fuck it why not write anonymously to a bunch of strangers. goodnight.",

My life has never been perfect but ever since October and especially mid November, when this guy I started seeing who was so sweet ended up molesting me and destroyed me mentally, and another guy who tried doing similar when I was sobbing in his arms about the previous guy. Everything went so downhill and hasn't stopped I'm so so tired. At least in death everything will stop and everything will be a void, maybe it'll get lonely but soon I'll lose my sense of self and everything will go quiet. It's such a shame I just started fixing my relationship with my mother and i love my little sister so much but I can't do this anymore, I need a break. ",

Yeah , that's probably a very common human experience. Difference is, I feel neutral persistently. I don't ever feel sad or happy. Just nothing. \n\nI feel like I don't really have that much control over my life. I go to school, go home, spend the whole day doing almost nothing and go to sleep. I guess I'd like to live, though I don't really know how to life different than that. I've been living like this for a long time now. I honestly feel like days, weeks and months are passing by without any meaning. It doesn't really bother me though, I don't have strong feelings towards it or anything. \n\nMy deepest desire is to talk to someone who'd understand me. Though, there is no one. I have friends and family but I neither can open up, not has one of them done trough something similar. I just want someone to hug me, tell me that eventually there will be genuine happiness for me and that everything will be okay and that they love me and that I'll just have to persist and... well I'm fantasising again. I btw do that a lot. I basically live rent free in my own head. \n\nI don't feel anything in the small happy things anymore either. Playing video games? Stopped that because it felt too meaningless. Food? I only eat what's there and what I'm used to. Literally all my food always tastes the same and I'm content with it most of the time. Hobbies? I have two, reading and writing. Both of them feel like work to me though. I'm like \"I have to do something meaningful today\" and since these two things are the only things that seem meaningful to me that I can do (except praying), I stress about them. When I do them though, they are the only things that give me a little Joy. And yeah, all other things that'd make one feel joy I either don't have or Don't make me feel Joy. I've never fallen in love since i was 8, have almost no desire for anything (I don't know if I'm just aroace or not able to feel these things because of my human condition, besides i just dont desire anything really) and don't really pursue anything in my current state of life. \nI wish I could live through the basic teen experiences, but I can't. \n\nI don't feel to have any meaningful relationships. Those I have feel superficial and a bit hollow, those that are somewhat intimate, I can't open up to those people. I happen to feel lonely sometimes, though most of the time I'm glad to have so little to do with people besides school. I'm extremely introverted, as one might have ready been able to tell. \n\nCan't think of anything else. \nReminder: I don't ever feel sad, or down, or depressed, or grieving, or pressured, or hollow or anything like that. I just feel nothing. Thus, my 3 moods are basically neutral, socially performing and rarely angry. Yeah, the only strong emotion I rarely feel is anger. \n\nI don't feel like writing any more though there are like a gazillion things I could write. \n\nIs that depression? Probably not, though it might not seem like it I'm actually very content with my life. Not fulfilled or satisfied or happy, but content. I've been living like this for a long time. So, I kinda got used to it. I have pretty much given up hope that life will become great and accepted that its just okay. So, if there is no cure to that, it wouldn't pressure or shock me. This actually seems like what life for most people most of the time gotta be like. \n\n\n\n",

And here I am, lazy, overwhelmed, unmotivated, unconcentrated and unhappy.\n\nI’d like more friends but because of the depression I’m not social, I can’t talk.\n\nI wish I was more like a robot, just go to work, work hard, come home, cook and relax. But I can’t do it anymore. \n\nIf there was one thing I could change it would be everything about myself. \n\nI don’t see any other solution then to end it. I feel like I should have never been born.

My students were experts in literature, avid home cooks learning recipes from all over the world, and championship esports players. I reached and crushed performance goals. Students who barely knew English wrote excellent essays, and student who previously hated reading now enjoyed it. \n\nWhen I was a teacher, in October and early November, my depression was close to remission. I found happiness in dating a coworker. I listened to Tommee Profit, Fleurie, and Random Chance. \n\nAfter the bus crash, my district non-renewed my contract, leaving me in the dark. The last thing keeping me in this world, was gone.\n\nAs Oklahoma fell into a dark, icy cold, I have started to feel more and more brittle. I forced myself to find new work, even if it led me closer to my suicide. I work until late in the mornings, 9pm-6am. I listen to songs by Badflower and Suffershade and Essenger as I reminisce about those who have replaced and forgotten me,, and take the first careful steps on the ice toward the unspooling day.  \n\nI can't do this anymore. I can't spend time among the living, anymore. \n\nI use to MEAN SOMETHING. I WAS  LIVING PROOF that no matter what you've been through, abuse, violence, homelessness, addiction, food insecurity and binge eating, depression, and no matter how alone you stand, you can achieve your life dream through resilience, grit, and hard work. \n\nNow, I sell what little youth I have left for a pitiful wage, to a corporation that will never know my name, stocking shelves for customers I'll never see. I am a man of the night, evidence of being alive only in the tax books that take half of my back broken money. \n\nNow, exiled from my life's dream, my ears are open but my eyes remain closed and blurry from my Parnate and Nortriptyline. What used to be a life where I neared remission, has become dim and cold . The only picture that looks clear to me is when I pass a mirror, and recognize my face as it emerged from the tray. An unrecognizable man, with lifeless eyes, unkempt curly afro and beard, and bags under my eyes expanding the dark ,soulless look on my face. \n\nAfter fighting the depression and trauma of 13 years, through a babysitter who forced me to play \"the humping game\" to my stepfather who beat me until I cried and screamed and begged, to my mom who laughed at my pain, to the fear and pain homelessness brought, to the adjustments of college, I have nothing left to fight for. I acheived my life's dream, and now, I will never reach it again.\n\nMy mental and physical health are now matching what my emotions always were.\n\nDead.",

    "selftext": "I’ve struggled with (diagnosed) PTSD, Depression and Anxiety for over 10 years. And my last suicide attempt was basically successful, but my boyfriend was there and he realised just soon enough that I had taken too many pills and made me purge for about 45 minutes until chunks and chunks of half dissolved pills came out. When I couldn’t do it anymore all my body lost feeling and I became pale, couldn’t move and could barely speak. He thinks, based off the amount I took, that he had gotten over half of them out after I couldn’t take it anymore and fell to the floor. He called poison control and they told him to take me to the ER or I would die soon, and he told them he got a lot of pills out and elaborated, the man told him to take me to the ER still but that he might have bought time if not saved my life. \n\nHe carried me to the car and I think when we got there someone put me in a wheelchair. They asked me all these questions but I couldn’t respond and my body was so pale I could see all my veins everywhere. I remember seeing things on my skin but it was hallucinations and I can’t remember anything more from that night except that I was crying for my little brother and sad about not seeing my parents as we aren’t on good terms. I passed out for hours I don’t know what was done during that time but I remember the nurses thanking my boyfriend profusely for what he had done and I realised the severity of what I did. \n\nBacktrack I agreed, kind of, to not refusing the purge after he looked me in the eyes after panicking and said “babe please work with me or you’re going to die. You’re going to die”\n\nI’m a very small woman. I’m 23 and my healthy weight is 98lbs I’m blasian, I mostly keep to myself. The doctor told me later on when I came to, that the pills I took were the “worst ones” I could have overdosed on and that it’s fatal for anyone to take a few, let alone someone my size and that I was lucky to be alive because my bf made me vomit most of them out otherwise I wouldn’t have made it alive to the hospital most likely and if I did it would have been too late.\n\nSorry for the long post. After I understood my situation on day 2 (hospital suicide watch) I was so sad. I didn’t speak much and I laid there and looked at the ceiling and the curtains and wires that were zip tied together and the door I wasn’t allowed to close. I couldn’t walk on my own for 3 days and when I finally could it was only for a few minutes or I’d fall. My internal systems obviously took a massive hit and were seemingly put to sleep. I was sent to a facility straight from the hospital. It was either that or jail, apparently. I was told 3-5 days but was there for a week. \n\nNow, my birthday is coming up soon and my boyfriend and I butt heads a lot and we have been, on top of me feeling like dying every day and I’m just so tired. I feel pathetic for failing even though I didn’t technically fail, but I feel so upset and sad and I hate taking meds but I feel like maybe I should start because I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. I don’t know what worth I have to be on this planet. I don’t even know what I was trying to say anymore sorry if this post isn’t allowed. I’m just so lost and tired. I’m a smart girl but I feel like I’m just wasting away and can’t get out of my head.\n\n",

I’ve been on my own for about 2 years now and have started going to the doctor for the first time in 7 years. I decided to go to a psychiatrist because of some issues I just can’t take anymore. I was diagnosed with OCD which kinda confused me as I don’t know too much about it. I haven’t been able to get more than 3-6 hours of sleep for two years. My brain won’t shut off and I have racing thoughts about things I need to get done that are stressing me out or scenarios that could happen, concerns about my brother and his family, concerns about my future, my dog, past experiences that I read into and wonder what they’re emotions towards me we’re. I am so tired but just can’t sleep. I’ve tried lots of things except prescription meds because I wanted to get the source. It’s takes me about 3 days of no sleep for me to randomly be sitting on the couch or in a chair and I’ll wake up to my Partner saying \"you were asleep like that for 3 hours\". If I clean for long hours, basically exhausting myself, I’m able to lay down and sleep for about 6 hours but I wake up on the hour with my heart beating like I’m anxious. I feel like most the time I have no personality or purpose and nothing brings me joy. Then I randomly get these bursts of energy like I can’t sit still have to clean or run and there a million thoughts going through my head and I feel like I could be some big shot CEO and build a house 😂 something my partner pointing out was that if someone says something or something happens that give some even the slightest negative emotion I just spiral and start thinking about how hopeless I am. I am so mentally exhausted and the only thing that keeps me going is that I have to be here for my partner and my pup dog. I repeat to myself that I just need to bite my tongue and wait this out until I have burst of energy and happiness again. I am also very organized. Not in the head, that’s all over the place 😂😅 but my room is spotless and precise and I can’t live without my multiple notebooks that I write lists for everything in/journaling. I’ll write a list of things to do when I’m hyper and then feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated after that hyper feeling goes away. I’m only a little bothered with germs, I don’t let my partner kiss the top of my hand, touch my face, or I’ll clean his cup really well so there’s no germs on it. I’m just worried that he might get sick. I definitely get really anxious over talking to people but as soon as I do I become this charismatic person that knows how to ask the right questions and keep the person talking about themselves to make them like me even though I find talking to people kind of unbearable:/ I apologize that this is so long and I appreciate anyone who reads this or even makes it this far. I’m also Sorry it’s all over the place 😅 This is my first time being diagnosed with anything/seeking help. My family never hugs or says I love you so talking about emotions feels wrong and I’m nervous about this whole process. I’ve been prescribed Fluvoxamine and have a follow up in a month so we’ll see how it goes!",

He would watch me shower three or four times and tell me I still smelled bad, brush my teeth for me because I wasn't doing it good enough, tells me my mother doesnt love me(which im scared he is right about). I feel as I have gotten older that I got over that stuff but when I'm alone with my thoughts it's a very bad place to be. Being alone has become  so mind numbingly painful, i have Noone to talk to. I live with my mom and step dad and I feel so disconnected from them, it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. I tell them whay im going through and its just nothing. \n\n\n\nMy parents have really set me up to fail. My mother pulled me out of school when I was 13, she believes that I was being brainwashed and that she could teach me far better. A couple days of \"home schooling\" and she lost interest and dropped it. Now here i am at 21 with no social skills, no job, no money, no education, no car, no license. I HAVE NOTHING not a penny to my name. I am completely dependent on them and I have a feeling they hate it. She tells me that I need to grow up and figure out things for myself and I get that but at the same time I know nothing about living on my own or what to do for a job with no education or training for anything. \n\nI get that i sound like such a bitch rn and a lot of it is my fault but I need some guidance, i feel completely lost and I'm worried I'll be stuck with my parents til they die.\n",

I, like everyone on here, cant live in this state of despair forever. So I thought I'd reach out to my fav sub for advice on a couple things that have put me down quite a bit recently.\n\nIve had tons and tons of extremely intrusive thoughts about not wanting to exist, and being hateful towards myself. It seems like I only lash out on the people who actually care about what im going through. I find distracting myself with a screen, either video games or social media works, but it feels like as soon as the distraction is gone, the thoughts flood back in instantaneously. I have so much anger that stems from these thoughts, i want them to go away so desperately, it angers me they are there in the first place. If i feed into them i end up crying, shaking and convulsing all while i feel like I'm burning up. This is the point where I want to self harm, I've only ever smacked my head into walls, I cant explain it but it feels really good. I need tips on how to deal with these intrusive negative thoughts.\n\nPart 2, ive had a chronic illness since I was 14 (Crohns) and after diagnosis and the hell it felt like i went through, I haven't had many issues at all until this recent monday, i couldnt fucking move the pain was so debilitating. I work 5 days a week in a very blue collar environment. I can't stand the one guy i work with. He makes fun of me for fucking everything, mainly targets my crohns. I had taken 2 days off last week because of my mental health, I had lied to my boss and said it was my crohns but in reality I was just so overwhelmed I really didn't wanna wake up at 6. I obviously heard it from my coworker saying shit like \"you have sand in your vagina again\". Then comes this Monday where I actually have a crohns pain(feels like karma). I leave after being there for a couple hours and go get sorted, I took Tuesday off to do some tests for my doctor. This dick called me just to make fun of me while i was off these past 2 days. now I'm dreading going back to work. I dont want to hear it from this guy i swear I'm gonna punch him and get fired, feels like a 2 birds with one stone solution(hate him and my job) but obviously violence isn't a option. How do you guys deal with difficult people.",

alot of times and she comes running to me all mad at me and everything and pulls my ear and drags me to the corner for not listening to her and than about 20 minutes later my dad comes out and pulls me away from the corner and he says to me I use to be kind and im not kind anymore and he asks why im acting out and I say to him I dont like her and he asks me why and I say to him I dont know because I was afraid to say it to him im not good at communicating well when it comes to things like this and after I said I dont know my dad slapped me and told me to go sit in the car I was crying the whole time I was talking to him in the corner and he some how didnt get the idea that something must be wrong and the next day my little brother went into the bathroom and came out my Step mom went in and came out asking me and my little brother who forgot to flush the toilet and I was wondering why she would even ask this and flush it herself its no big deal but she makes it seem like one and so I respectively and nicely said I wasnt the one in the bathroom and she told me to go to my room to think about what I did wrong because I was arguing with her when I wasnt I was only answering her simple question and than later she comes into my room and confronts me about what I did wrong I got so mad I yelled at her and told her I was gay and than she says my mom doesnt love me and she does and than she goes on and on about how im gonna get diseases for being gay and about how its unhealthy and she even used the bible as an excuse to her being homophobic and ignores the fact real christians arent supposed to judge and she said being gay is a choice and you dont feel that way and she randomly brought up my aunt on my dads side saying she changed and is now marrying a man and when she didnt win the argument she sent me to live with my mom full time and I was glad about that because I didnt wanna deal with her anymore and my moms a kind and loving person and shes better than my Stepmom in fact shes like one of the kindest people I know I also think my Step mom love bombed my dad into being with her and I think my Step mom manipulated my dad because my parents break up was over all because my mom wouldnt get a job and my dad was struggling with his job a little so he needed more help and my Step mom had a job so I think she took advantage of my dad to leave my mom all because of it and to be with her I also talked to my aunt because my mom messenged her and I found out my Step mom lied about my aunt and shes married to a woman not a man my aunt even said to me the last time she saw my dad was at the wedding my dad also started missing me and talking to me more and he wants me to be nice to my Step mom and he says if It wasnt for her we wouldnt have a roof under our heads and I dont think thats true at all im sure theres someone on my dads side of the family that would love to take us in and I think my dads only saying this because my dad must of called my Step mom out and she pointed it out to make herself seem innocent and just because she does something kind like making sure theres a roof under our heads doesnt mean shes a good person but my dad apparently falls for her manipulative ways easily and im not gonna be respectful to someone like that I also dont sleep much at night and cry most of the night wishing I never said ya to them getting married and I miss when my parents were together ",

Fast forward to Sunday I'm home alone all day and I start feeling thoughts like I didn't want to be here any more. I'm tired, burned out, haven't slept since Wednesday night by this point. I'm extremely emotional all day crying my eyes out by myself. I catch myself on just before everyone else comes home from work or whatever else they were doing. fast forward to today I started making active plans for ending my life in my head. I told my mental health practitioner about this, I told her it's just thoughts not an actual action plan that I'd never kill myself because death scares me and it opens up a whole can of worms. she tells me to wait in her room while she makes a few phone calls. She rang my dad and sister and told them that I was planning to kill myself even though it was just thoughts and that killing myself is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I would never in a million years kill myself because death is the number one thing that scares me most but I have always been curious about what it's like to die and be dead. again death scares me especially because I don't know what is beyond life is it lights out total darkness or do we have an afterlife. anyways I get home and my dad and sister give me the worst talking to in my life. feeling worse than ever right now wish I never opened my mouth about how I truly feel. Lesson learned I won't be sharing how I truly feel again and NO this isn't a troll post. it legit happened to me today. My sister and dad are extremely angry with me right now.

    "selftext": "I have asked so many people, SO MANY FUCKING PEOPLE why I should keep living. Every single person says something along the lines of:\n\nSome shit about Jesus and living in the holy spirit of the Lord\n\nMarriage/Having a baby\n\nFinding the meaning of life\n\nThey're all bullshit. I have no reason to keep living. Seriously, I think everyone is just lying to each other and saying there's a point to life because they're afraid of death. But why should I be scared? And why am I scared?\nThe \"find your own meaning\" answer really gets to me. There's a question we should be asking ourselves: What is the outcome?\nWhy are we continuing to live in this world? What would finding out our \"destiny\" or making a big contribution to the Earth matter? \n\nStudying science also makes this even more clear to me. From what I can see, there's no point to the universe. There's no end goal to the stars burning in the sky. There's no end goal to species evolving. What's the point? If the entire universe disappeared out of existence and everything was nothing, it's not like anything could happen anymore. If anyone at this very moment just stopped existing, they wouldn't be able to complain because they wouldn't exist. \n\nSo what's the point of existing? What's the point of living? What's the point of being in a situation that we don't have to be in? \n\nEspecially when the situation we find ourselves in is shit. When I and other people with depression find ourselves in a bad situation, we want to kill ourselves. But we should also be pointing out that it's usually because of unique personal problems. Sure, we lose people to suicide every day. This may not be true for all people who have committed suicide, but they usually do it because they're in a bad situation.\n\nWhich is why I'm so confused by all of this. I am not depressed because I have a horrible life, though it's not the best. I'm depressed because I'm so scared of death but so certain of my pointlessness. It's not even that I find myself to be pointless in the grand scheme of things, even though that's true. It's that I find everything to be pointless, even the grand scheme of things. \n\nWell, anyway, I've gotten away from my main point. I don't feel like living just because I don't think anyone should feel like living. If anyone (hopefully) understands my point and has an alternative, please please reply. I'm still scared of death and would love to see if there is a point to life.",

I got back with my old friends got a regular job and a girlfriend that I wanted to marry. Cut forward a couple of month and she left me after cheating and giving HSV2, all my friends left me behind because \"I wasn't the same\", and I lost my job. Eventually I started working again and found some roommates so I could finally leave that fucking motel. It didn't last for long tho because they kept using my money for drugs (1000 a month btw) until eventually we lost the house. After that I lost by job due to me finally snapping under the pressure from it all. Eventually I got a different job and an apartment but life wasn't done fucking with me. I met this wonderful girl who I shared so many things with and things started moving quickly. For the first time I felt like I wasn't alone and I wasn't numb anymore. Eventually like so many others before she became abusive in a way I had never dealt with before. Every day was a roller coaster that sent me in a constant spiral until my health started getting worse and worse. All I wanted was peace and a chance to breathe but I couldn't. I used to be able to go numb or disassociate but with her it's like that wasn't possible. Eventually she cheated and shit wasn't the same so we broke things off after 6 months.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \n\nI’m a 22-year-old female, not overweight, and I’ve been taking Sertraline since early October. I started at 25 mg and gradually increased to 125 mg (my psychiatrist said I could go up to 150 mg if needed). I’m taking it for depression and skin picking. I take my full Sertraline dose every day at 9 AM.  \n\nOverall, I feel like Sertraline is helping – it gives me more energy and has slightly improved my mood. However, I’ve been having severe sleep issues since starting the medication, and it’s really wearing me out.  \n\nI wake up multiple times during the night, usually first around 2 AM, then again at 4 AM, 5 AM, 6 AM, and 8 AM. I just want to sleep 8 hours straight, but it feels impossible. Before starting Sertraline, I was able to fall asleep quickly and get around 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Now, even when I do fall asleep, I wake up often, and it can take me anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes (sometimes longer) to get back to sleep. I believe I wake up from REM sleep every time because I can clearly remember my dreams. I also tried using the Sleep Cycle app, and based on my experience with it, I suspect that I’m waking up at the end of each sleep cycle.  \n\nMy psychiatrist previously prescribed Mirtazapine to help with sleep, but I had to stop taking it due to rapid weight gain, which wasn’t good for my mental health – I gained a lot of weight in just two weeks, and it worsened my depression. I also currently take extended-release melatonin every day at 9 PM, which helps me feel a bit drowsy and stay asleep longer, but I still experience these waking phases throughout the night. I make sure to go to bed by 10 PM at the latest and try to fall asleep shortly after, but despite sticking to this routine, I still struggle with these issues. I feel like the melatonin just masks the issue rather than solving the underlying problem.  \n\nHas anyone experienced similar sleep problems with Sertraline? Do you have any tips for improving sleep? Should I bring this up with my psychiatrist, or maybe consider lowering the dose?  \n\nThanks so much for any advice!  ",

Girlfriend broke up with me, lost a a grandparent and then someone i knew from univeristy died. Felt like every time i was finally picking myself up i just kept getting pushed further and further down. This all happened just after I graduated University where i though things would only be getting better. Moving in with my girlfriend, starting a new carrer and finally being fully self relient. However, instead of this i was just left feeling like shit. As a result of this I threw myself deeply into work and pushed myself to the extreme where i started having debilitating panic attacks and had to stop working. The panic attacks got so bad that i could barely function and couldn't leave my house. This resulted in my just staring at my bedroom walls contempleting every life decision i have ever made whilst questioning my ability to do anything ever again. Convinced myself that i would no longer be able to do anything i enjoyed again, not be able to find work, not be able to socalise and meet new people, not be able to go to the gym and this all led me to the ultimate position of just \"what even is the point\" with everything that I do.\n\nMy anxiety has gotten better and i have been going out more often then before but i just dont see the point anymore. I have been going back to the gym but this is more of an escape as it allows me to forget about what is actually going on in my life but as soon as i leave the gym the realisation of everything just hits so instead of getting that eurphoric feeling, i just feel awful. The same goes for socalising with friends. I find myself just sitting there and observing and being sat in my own little bubble. I find it extremely difficult to stay in conversation with people as i just start completely zoning out and just not listening to anything they are saying no matter how hard i try and remember. This then fuels the thought cycle of not being able to work as how am i supposed to have conversations with people when all i can do is sit there and nod my head.\n\nIm also dealing with some exerstential crisis. My thinking is whats the point of doing anything when we are all going to end up in a wooden box and that just freaks me out. Makes me thing that everthing i say and do has no meaning. As a result, this has complitely crushed any sort of drive, ambition, and purpose that i once had. I have tried setting myself small goals like making sure i keep my room clean, having basic meals, regular excercise etc but i always feed back into this same loop. I used to enjoy waking up in the morning and now i dread going to sleep.\n\nThank you to anyone who reads this and would really appreciate any sort of support. As i was writting this it turned into a bit of a rant to get things off of my chest so i hope it makes sense. :)",

I’m 23 (M) about to turn 24 next month and for most of my life I’ve been dealing with depression, possibly a personality disorder and I think everyone around me would agree that I’m definitely undiagnosed ADHD or some other type of neurodivergence. I have walked through life feeling like a black sheep for 23 years, I don’t feel as though I fit in with my family, I can’t keep consistent friends and my love life is just as bad. I feel as though there is something fundamentally wrong-with/unlikeable-about me everytime I’m in social situations and I don’t know how to change it.\n\nI’m a very creative person which is unfortunately highly adjacent to mental illness, this has made finding a career and making ends meet very difficult, I just lost my job last month working for a local business that I thought would treat their staff better than a big company *I was so wrong*, finding work has been near impossible since there is a recession in my country and little jobs are going round and even then I’m not hopeful I’ll find a job that’s not some soulless dead-end minimum wage job. My passion is woodworking and making bespoke items which makes me happy but a really hard skill set to apply to today world and industries, I’ve tried to find work in adjacent trades but no employers (country wide) seem to want to take on apprentices or anyone with less than two years experience. I was never very good at school and I’ve never really considered myself to be very intelligent and I’ve never felt very fulfilled in my past retail and hospo jobs which is all I can really get with the experience I have so I don’t know what else I can do.\n\nBack in November before I lost my job I left my partner of 10 months (27F) which unfortunately meant I had to move back in with my parents, while a short relationship I still feel a huge loss, it was a fun and loving relationship for the first 3-5 months but quickly changed and ultimately ended because she was very controlling, hypocritical and an alcoholic (far beyond my own substance habits) who go abusive especially but not exclusively when she was drunk, it took a lot of strength for me to walk away in truth I didn’t think I could survive another relationship breaking down so dramatically but now I am without the security companionship and my friends (who were also hers and remain to be). She still occasionally messages me usually apologising and hoping we can get back together before she soon starts a fight over how everything was my fault, and sadly the truth is I really miss her and still love her in some way but after how she’s treated me I’m not sure I’m even attracted to her anymore and I know it would be the same if we got back together.\n\nFor the short time I have been an adult I have noticed a pattern of spending a couple years trying to get all the pieces of my life in place only for it to all fall apart in under 12 months back to square one… broke, alone, living with my parents in the town I grew up in with no way out. I don’t really feel like living anymore, I don’t want to and it doesn’t seem worth it, I have a good therapist but it really feels like I’ll never conquer my own internal shit storm. I’m getting a decent amount of money from getting fired unjustly but I think I should leave it to my family who are struggling financially because I think it’s wasted on me ",

I don’t know what triggered the sudden change in my personality but roughly 3 weeks ago I began to avoid speaking to people. My anxiety was off the walls, I could hardly muster up the courage to have a conversation with a cashier. It grew progressively worse over time to where I was struggling to even speak with my coworkers. I started to call off or lie that I was sick to avoid any form of interaction because it genuinely did make my stomach turn thinking about having to speak or talk. I don’t go anywhere other than to work and where I live. Fast forward to now I’m still severely anxious but now I’ve been completely avoiding people in general. I don’t want to talk or call, I don’t care about little and pointless conversations, I don’t even bother talking to my partner no more either because obviously the relationship is toxic and I’m not wasting my energy on that either. I genuinely dread coming home to this person and I also dread having to live with them anymore. I can’t sleep, I can hard bring myself to eat anymore leading up to this week where I have completely stopped eating for the past 3 days. I have no one genuinely talk to about this. I am so depressed and irritable. I don’t know what to do. I’ve always struggled extremely bad but this time genuinely am clueless. ",

I regularly dissociate during this time, and it can sometimes be hard for my wife to “bring me back.” It’s also been really affecting me longer-term, as I’m constantly in my own head with no way out.

Right now I’m 20, taking part-time college classes while I figure out what I want to major in. I don’t know of anything I’m confident I’ll enjoy. \nI have a couple hobbies that bring me some peace and purpose, but it’s not enough. I play in a local metal band & write most of the music. This is where I find the most joy in life, but it’s infamously difficult to make any money off of music so I don’t have any confidence in this as anything more than a passion. Beyond that, most interests I have are for things that are similarly useless for money, like archaeology or Religious Studies. I don’t think there’s anything I could do for a living that would also make me happy.\n\nI had a partner for 5 years, and our relationship was amazing for the most part, but after we came to college together she became poly and cheated on me, leading to our breakup. This was about 5 months ago, and since then I’ve felt so unbelievably lonely. \n\nI remember assuming when I was 8 that I would eventually die by suicide. I’ve never found much joy in being human. It just feels like it’s not for me. The immense amount of effort required to make a successful life for yourself doesn’t feel worth it when every step along that path is crushingly painful and miserable. I don’t know what to do. I can’t kill myself because my mom is dealing with her parents aging and struggling with cancer. If I died, I would absolutely wreck both my parents. But every day feels like torture and I don’t know why and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going. \n\nI must have done something really truly heinous in a past life, because to exist as I do feels like nothing short of a spiritual punishment. It’s like there’s an alien floating behind my head, invisible, at all times, harvesting my soul for pain and suffering. I don’t know what to do. ",

I know I messed up badly with my studies, but that’s the reality, and there’s no turning back now. This year, I just can’t seem to find the motivation to do better. I make plans for studying well before a test, but when the time comes, I don’t follow through. I often end up cramming the night before or sometimes taking tests without studying at all, which, unsurprisingly, doesn’t turn out well most of the time.\n\nI feel like I’m so far behind my peers, and it feels impossible to catch up. I’m also consumed by guilt because I’m lying to my family about how I’m doing in college. I can’t bring myself to tell them the truth. What makes it worse is that I’m not even sure this college or degree is the right fit for me anymore. But at the same time, I don’t know what else I want to do. There are a few things that interest me, but I haven’t explored them much.\n\nI’ve thought about studying those fields independently, maybe through courses and certifications, and eventually getting a job. But I’m terrified I’ll fail at that too. I worry that I’m not smart enough to succeed. Lately, I’ve even considered quitting college entirely, which I’ve been debating for a while. But the thought of quitting fills me with even more guilt because I live with my parents, and they’ve spent so much money on my education. I feel like a burden—like I’m not contributing to the household.\n\nI’ve thought about getting a job, moving out, and doing online courses in my free time, but I don’t know how realistic that is. Recently, I had a mental breakdown over everything, and it got so bad that I thought about ending my life. It wasn’t the first time I’ve had such thoughts. I’m not officially diagnosed, but I suspect I might be depressed, and I’m working on seeking help.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I feel stupid, worthless, and incapable.

I have posted on similar subreddits before— i dont know why i need to explain this, i think it is to convince myself im not just seeking attention. I dont want to bother my friends because they already have a lot going on.\nrecently i was in some sort of relationship with a 34 year old because he genuinely made me feel wanted and i was lonely. I liked him a whole lot and we had plans to meet up until my friend found out and basically cussed him out of my life. I feel guilty because i am fully aware that he is a pedophile— and that by talking to him, i was enabling him. I have been in such relationships in the past, all for the same reasons. I feel very ashamed and guilty for enabling these horrid people, and i dont feel like i can tell many people that, because it will prove that im fully aware of my actions and still do them- which i am, but in some sort of way, its just…like an ugly state of mind when i get into these things. I cant explain it.\nI am very very tired. And bordering on suicidal thoughts- mainly because im scared, cause i always am. Im on the average side of looks, and i would say that im a bit above average in smarts. i believe i will go to a decent uni to study architecture even though i am scared of getting sick of it— it is very versatile and involves a lot of skills, so. Im currently studying for the chemistry and history olympiads (aomw sorr of contests) this and next week. I got 4th place in the romanian olympiad (essay writing) last week. I still dont feel accomplished whatsoever, and its sending me into a spiral again. Im surrounded by smarter people, and it just makes me feel horrible, even though rationally i am aware that my grades and efforts are no laughing stock. \nSorry for the long post, im just ranting. I need to explain because i feel like if i dont i sound worse. But i am tired and i keep doubting myself and ill repeat it again- im so so so very tired. I have so much work and i never enjoy anything anymore, because im constantly pressuring myself to read or do something that will make me smarter- i cant remember the last time i did something because it was silly and fun and not because it would help my college apps or my knowledge or whatever. Theres a pit in me and being busy keeps it away but it also feeds it, and i cant keep it in myself. I feel like im the stupidest person alive. Im constantly ashamed. I feel guilty. \nIf it gives any background- it’s mostly how ive been raised since i was 9. At every mistake ive made my mother would yell that im selfish and egoistic and that im ruining her- i think that plays a part in it. Shes not abusive anymore, she stopped when i hit 10th grade. Im going offtopic again, im sorry. \nYeah. I just dont know what to do or what i want or how to get this out. Im tired is all",

Now it's been 3 years that I'm struggling with being in a \"stagnant\" or a \"motionless\" state, I feel chronically tired, I try to be outdoors as much as possible in the hopes of feeling something different but I just don't, I can't get anything done, I don't care abt my studies anymore, I feel like I'm physically and mentally stuck and there's no way out and there's nothing I can do about it, I hate myself and trick myself into thinking that I don't.

I feel like I’m detaching from everyone, even my closest friends. When I have conversations with people I just feel like I can’t relate or they can’t relate. I just kind of feel like I’m disassociating. I’m constantly having suicidal thoughts. Even when I’m out with friends and “having a good time”, they’ll just randomly pop in my head. I can’t stop them. I have a mixed feelings relationship with my mother, she was physically, emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive towards me as a child but only emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive in my teenage years. As a teenager and young adult, me and my mother had a close enough relationship that I would consider her my best friend. When I got into this toxic and abusive relationship that I’m currently in, my relationship with my mother quickly begin to decline and become estranged. My relationship with my best friend has also dwindled. I’ve isolated myself bc of my relationship and pushed people away. I feel alone and doomed. I’m so fucking sick and tired of the toxicity of my relationship but I love her so much and I just can’t walk away from it. I feel that suicide might be the only option for me. However, I don’t think I’ll ever actually do it. I’m just stuck in this constant cycle of depression and feeling like I want to die. I’m so stressed out that my immune system is shitty af and I’m always sick. I’m pretty positive I will die from cancer due to the stress or maybe a heart attack or a stroke if suicide isn’t the way. I can feel that I’m an unbearable person to be around bc I’m CONSTANTLY in a bad mood, I’m constantly yelling and angry. I already had anger issues growing up but they have gotten so much worse since I’ve entered this relationship. I’m in a permanent state of stress and anxiety. I hate myself so much. I just feel so negative all the time but I’m the type of person who preaches positivity. I have nothing going for me in life. I just want to rip my hair out and scream. ",

I remember feeling too big, too ungirly, too idk. Just very uncomfortable, throughout the teenage years. And then I went to Uni and at first it got much worse, especially due to COVID and me being alone a lot. But then I made it back out and honestly felt pretty good about myself.\nHowever, like half a year after this significant improvement. I learned I was not heterosexual and it completely obliterated everything I had worked on. I am guessing that I developed then OCD, but my therapist, whom I saw with that was never fully sure, if she would classify it as this. Nevertheless, it was extremely destabilizing and I experienced crippling rumination, anxiety and depression...fleed into a relationship with a guy to suppress all of it. At first it worked but then as time progressed my mental health got extremely bad and it blew up all in my face. After the breakup I have just never been the same, maybe I wouldn't have been regardless. \nI would still say I struggle from dibilitating anxiety around myself and around other people. I would say I have chronic simmering depressive symptoms, never am really motivated, cannot experience emotions persistently and freely. I still get the rumination/OCD and feel very uncomfortable with being alone for longer periods of time. \nI have to add, in my family there is a long history of mental illnesses. My sister and father have ADHD, which I convinced myself to potentially having, but maybe that is also me avoiding reality.\nI am currently getting tested by a psychiatrist and am considering medication (ADHD or in general)\nI feel like such a failure, I feel like I have lost and destroyed everything in my life and didn't take the right steps earlier. I don't really recognize myself in the mirror anymore or maybe this is who I really am. I really hate that I am always struggling with my mental health. I guess I want to understand this, why I am always feeling so much, maybe there is no answer. \nMore of a vent/rant, but maybe someone has some tips/insights?\nThank you, kind stranger :)",

I pushed away good friends with negative thoughts that drained them.\n\n**My situation:**\n\nI recently quit my job because I couldn’t handle the constant human interaction. I’m currently working on a solo game project, so I spend most of my time alone in my room.\n\nI’m also pursuing a master’s degree in computer science, but I haven’t been able to connect with anyone in my class. Our project groups only meet at the university to work, and there’s no interaction beyond that.\n\nI enjoy playing guitar, but I only play alone. I’m too afraid to perform in front of others or join a club or community.\n\nI go to the gym regularly, but again, I do it alone. Day by day, I go through the same routine, but I still can’t make friends there.\n\nI’ve tried talking to people, but many of them have told me that I come across as awkward or strange in the way I behave and speak. I haven’t been able to form any new close friendships.\n\nWhen I go on dates, many girls have told me that I seem overly focused on money or think too much. I remember once saying something like this:\n\n*\"We humans are just animals. If you look at other animals, females choose males based on strength, the ability to provide, or any trait that makes the male stand out and benefit the female—and vice versa. Humans are no different. A man might be rich, a woman might be a great cook, he might be muscular, she might be beautiful, or they might simply understand each other well. There are many people out there who meet these criteria, so no one is truly destined for just one person. We simply choose the best match we can find.\"*\n\nWhy did I say something like that on a date? It made me sound like a weirdo.\n\nI don’t want to keep living like this alone, sitting in my room all day. But I don’t know what to do or where to start. I feel lost.\n\nEdit: I do not ever want to end my life or hurt myself over the time of depression. For years I just felt very stressed, vomited, and couldn't express my thoughts clearly to anyone even to parents or supervisors (teacher). ",

As a child, I never spoke about it to anyone. However, when I was 7 years old, while staying at my grandmother’s house, I tried to replicate what had been done to me with one of my cousins. My family discovered this, and my mother took me home without saying much. She consulted a friend, who advised her to take action to ensure I would never do it again. My mother heated a knife over a fire and pressed it against my hand. To this day, I have a scar from that incident, and whenever I see it, I am reminded of the abuse.\n\nMy childhood was deeply traumatic. As I grew older, I struggled immensely with my sexuality. For years, I believed that the abuse was the reason for my homosexuality. This internal conflict caused me significant pain and confusion. Over time, however, I reached a point where I began to accept and embrace my sexuality.\n\nI experienced severe depression, especially during my time at university. In high school, I had good grades, but everything changed when I started university. I’m not sure exactly what happened, but I lost all motivation to study or improve my life. Despite this, I managed to pass my courses and even started a job. Throughout this time, I was constantly battling mental health struggles (I think I have ADHD as well)\n\nThis year, I received devastating news: I was diagnosed with HIV. This was completely unexpected and has been incredibly difficult to process. Living in a deeply oppressive Muslim country adds another layer of pain and isolation to everything I’m going through.\n\nRight now, I feel overwhelmed, and it seems like there’s only one solution...",

    "selftext": "I wake up every single day and do the same thing. I have nothing. I want nothing, I am nothing. I’ve been a ghost for the past 8 years. Slowly succumbing to anti social and reclusive behavior. To the point that I don’t even want to do anything that involves people. I feel a flicker of longing every now and then.. like seeing a couple holding hands, or a movie with love and romance in it, I seldom feel this flicker, but when I do, it’s powerful. I am immediately reminded of course that I have no value, I’m not important or special, I’m just fucked up…\nI am not an ugly person mind you, I have had my fair share of relationships and lovers, I have people asking for my advice, or asking me to sing for them, they flatter me….but it feels artificial, and flimsy…\n\nI know what you’re thinking; “What right do you have to complain when you have, at the very least, people who admire you.” \nI can only say, it is a meticulously crafted, and carefully polished mask I wear for everyone. I cultivated a personality I believed would be appealing to others…\nThe real me is screaming in a pitch black void, begging for something, anything, to change how he feels…\nI hear him less and less now, and one day he will be gone altogether.\n\nI wish I knew when or what the catalyst for this was. Perhaps being cheated on, or the deaths of my friends. \nIt could be because I was psychologically tortured by my Step-Grandmother for the first 8 years of my life, and convinced me that my parents hated me and wanted me out of the way, maybe that helped develop this fucked up side of me. I really don’t know.\n\n I can’t point to a single event, perhaps it’s the culmination of all these things…. All I know is, I am now hollow, and devoid of any sense of purpose or peace. Just nothingness. \n\nNo one will ever know I wrote this except for you, dearest reader. \nI have an image to uphold after all. \n\nIf you ever need to escape, or need to isolate yourself from pain, construct a mask. Make it appeal to others, it has to hide the real you, and maybe if you’re lucky, the mask will become the real you and the other will fade into nothingness. \nGive your mask all the qualities you envy in others, use bits and pieces of different personalities you admire and make them your own. \n\nI have to warn you though, smothering the real you comes at a cost. As you see, I feel very little if anything anymore. Even if the most beautiful woman on earth came to me, and told me she loves me. \nGave me good reasons why, and what she loves about me. I wouldn’t and couldn’t believe her, because people are inherently liars, and fake. \n\nDon’t trust anyone with your true feelings. Hide them. Women see them as weakness. Society tells you boys don’t cry, so don’t. In front of anyone. Ever. \n\nDearest reader, you now know.\nOne of a very few. \nI do, in some way, hope you are nothing like me. \n\nMaybe you can find your way back to the light. Good luck.",

    "selftext": "I (21F), currently live with my parents and brother under the same roof. Parents treat me kind of better than they did when I was a kid, but everytime they show affection now feels fake. Fake to the point it physically hurts me from the pain I feel. I've even cried in secret after my mother tried hugging me(even when I asked her not to multiple times,to no avail and she makes a big deal when I say no).\n\nMy mother has bipolar and when I was a kid, she never took meds. Now,living with a bipolar person who dosen't take their meds is hell. Even though there were two of us(me and my brother), simple mistakes I did triggered her into bipolar episodes. Another trigger was her fighting with my father. All my life, I grew up watching them fighting and then her comparing me with my father, whom she hated the most in the world. \n\nI'll describe an episode for better explanation. It could get triggered by something as simple as me forgetting to fold clothes, and then her going into full silent treatment with me. Ignoring me as if I wasn't present there anymore. Not acknowledging my existence for weeks. Her not replying to anything I said. All while during this time, talking to my brother, serving him food, taking care of him,etc. Imagine a 10-12 year old girl going through this. The catch is, you never knew for what you would be getting this kind of treatment. On one day, forgetting to fold clothes could be completely normal, but on other days, you could get treated like a worthless doormat. You just never knew. \n\nAnd what my father did, was make me apologize to my mother for not being a good kid, when she calmed down. I think this went on until I was 18 or 19. \n\nI grew up feeling unloved and undesirable for most of my life. Unworthy of feeling loved. I worked hard and was a good student till highschool to compensate this and feel some sort of validation from my parents, but what I didn't notice then was my brother wasn't doing any sort of superhuman thing to not recieve the hatred I was receiving. \n\nFast forward some years, I've had extremely kind friends who love me with all their heart. I don't know what I would have been without them. They made me believe I didn't have to do anything to earn love. I could be loved for just who I am. \n\nNow, this fake affection thing from my parents is killing me. My heart breaks living in this house. Flashbacks from my childhood keep coming and simple things trigger me. People showing the same patterns as my parents. Someone raising their voice at me.  Also, I believe I'm sensitive than most people. It breaks my heart to break down at simple things and cry for no reason. \n\nIt's still 1.5 years until I graduate and move out. It feels like a lifetime away. Until then, I don't know how I'll cope up and stay sane. My mother once said she shouldn't have given birth to me. These words come back to me in my darkest hours. Again, I start feeling that I'm undeserving. But I don't want to go yet. I've so many things to do in this world,after I move out from this house. But that feels like an eternity away. And I don't know if I could hold on that long. My mind is a scary place. \n",

I have read various comments on some similar situations and the general advice is that this is a storm and it will pass but it feels really unbearable to me right now with nothing good in sight at all. Am also not that young anymore and I feel I just lost a full decade of hard work. \n\nAs a background I have been a successful trader at an investment bank for the last 10years. I have good degrees from Ivy League universities although I wouldn't consider myself amazingly smart, I am good enough and a hard worker and have done well so far on my own.  I had an amazing salary and decent bonuses but never really saved any money as I enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. Whether this was cars or living a bit beyond my means I always made it work given the decent end of year bonus that always used to put me back on track.  Huge mistake in hindsight. I had an amazing girlfriend and I have a loving dog and life seemed amazing up to this past summer. \n\nSuddenly things turned sour and deteriorated dramatically and very quickly. I suddenly got fired for gross misconduct from my firm on the back of an allegation about a foul comment I made to a female employee at a competing firm. I did make a wrong comment but I got accused for a way worse comment that I did not make. I was naive enough to think that the company would back me and believe me given the circumstances and didn't fight this as much as I could in the disciplinary proceedings. Another huge mistake. Fast forward a few months and after paying lawyers and appealing the decision which I lost, I got terminated and the paycheks stopped right there and there. I suddenly had to move out quickly out of my flat and pack my stuff into storage because I obviously couldn't pay my rent and bills any more. I had to seek emergency funds from my parents who have some money and assets but are not millionaires. On top of that, because of my job specifics and due to the misconduct termination I can't even get employed to competing firms because their HR would drop me. I received multiple calls from other banks to join them (I was decent on my job) but once they all heard the conduct termination admitted to me that they wouldn't actually be able to hire me.\n\nI decided to not rush and  just go back home for a bit and spend time with family, something that I haven't done in years while I relax a bit and think of my options. I had the sense of security mainly due to the fact that I had $500k in vested stock that I could liquiditade this January - so my plan was that I would repay the emergency funds to my parents, go travelling for a bit and then in a couple of months start thinking about which job I want and I can do (bearing in mind the above limitations). Fast forward to this morning, the day I could sell my vested stock and I realise that because I got terminated for cause, the full $500k is gone... it's stilly annoyingly in my name but after reading terms and conditions it's clear that my right to exercise anything on them has been terminated. So that's done... this stock was part of bonus payments of the last years - ie hard work and stress of mine and now it's all gone. I have no savings because i was thinking life as a child and never planned for misfortunes. On top of that my relationship with my girlfriend has deteriorated even before the summer job event because in the past I have hurt her because I cheated and never repaired the trust. I knew this was an issue that needed fixing but never took full initiative to resolve it in the past. I was cocky that I was the \"big dawg\" of the relationship and because we were in love I thought she would eventually overcome this without me doing much. Another mistake. Given am not in the country she is currently as am back with my parents, she now took the chance to take some time apart to try to heal herself. But for me it feels like I lost my job my home my girlfriend, any sense of stability I ever had. My dog is the only thing keeping me sane right now. I have an amazing car that I now also need to give back quickly as I don't want to be paying this high monthly payment. If I had my stocks, that I mistakenly thought I still had I would be in such a better situation.. \n\nTo not make my story longer. I have forever been a cheered up guy with always a smile on me. Since the summer, I feel depressed, nothing gives me joy anymore and if it wasn't for the pain I would incur to my parents and dog I have had moments that I have even thought of suicide. I know it sounds stretched but I really find my mind in dark places, especially when I think of how things have evolved. I feel I didn't deserve this, I was never a bad person to really anyone. I was cocky and loud but i have a good heart and got dropped by everyone in a second. From here I don't know what to do. It's more urgent for me to find a job now but I don't have motivation. I have to start over at 33 and feel like a massive loser when most of my friends are successful and happy. I can't believe I was there only 5 months ago and now have pretty much 0. No love no money no smile. I have increased my alcohol consumption tenfold as this is the only time I don't think of the shitshow I found myself in. I know I am unfair to worst situations out there and I am in advance sorry for this. I don't want to offend anyone I just needed some advice and to really take it off my chest but life to me right now feels unbeareable.

A bad experience at 13 made it even more stressful so I just avoided it completely. I was also not as attracted when I was younger so nobody really had their eye on me. Now I have grown up and am perceived as much more attractive than I used to be and girls will be interested in me but my past holds me back so much and I can’t see myself as attractive or imagine anyone ever being attracted to me.\n\nDue to this I end up coming across as dismissive when really I’m just anxious asf. I have had situations where I could have started a relationship but because I’ve never been in one I would rather just not confront it and so I run away (not actually run just desperately try to get out of the situation) and don’t pursue anything.\n\nI feel like a f*cking loser because of this. A lot of my friends have all been in long and really good relationships and I have genuinely never felt loved by another person in my entire life. I can’t imagine a world where anybody loves me and I feel like a weirdo because I haven’t had a girlfriend before at 19. Makes it really hard to be in a positive mood. I wish I could just say f*ck it and go after what I want but I’m too much of a p*ssy and I feel like it’s too late to bother trying. No I’m not an incel btw, just depressed, I feel like it’s too late to bother trying with most things in life.\n\nPlease, any advice would be appreciated.",

    "selftext": "looking at social media so many young people (early 20s, or even 18/19) are able to move out, buy a car, pay for all expenses (medical, house etc) like it's nothing \n\nI've just had to consider buying a car, because the one I've been driving is old and almost dead. It's a monthly rate and it's not that high...if you don't do anything else. I NEED a car because I live in a sort of secluded place and there's no access to public transport. Most workplaces won't even hire you if you don't have a car, because they know public transport is shit here, and they want \"flexible work hours\" aka if you aren't ready to travel at demand, you're a liability. \n\nSo there's also that. The job market is hell. After getting my degree, I was rejected even by fast food places. I went to so many interviews. I've managed to get hired by a bookstore chain and my pay is not atrocious, but it's a lot of work and I'm basically gripping onto it. They hired me as a part-time and I've had to break my back in order to show I can be hired as a full-time indefinitely. Now I'm full-time, but in a \"trial period\" because initially they had no intention to keep me. Will they? \n\nI'm in a net of small towns, where the jobs are 60% given to relatives. The ones that do hire you, they're infamous for staff recycling. One year and you're out, next one that comes in we can pay a little less than we would you. So job uncertainty, a location that demands you have a car or else you're cut off from everywhere. 4 years of payments. \n\nMy question is, I'm barely standing NOW, that I'm living at my parent's house. How the fuck will I be able to move out? Because according to people online, if you don't move out you're a shame to society or something. But I literally cannot. I would like to. My family is not a happy one and it's detrimental to my mental health. But I literally cannot otherwise. If the job market is shit, the house market is straight up diarrhea. My zone does not want people to live alone. It's only sustainable if you have a partner, and nobody does roommates. Even people who consider roommates shy away from it because \"well I might meet somebody I like since I'm young\" and they go wait for their soulmate. It's ok, but a single person cannot live alone. Even my brother, who worked 12 hours a day for years and had much more money than I do now, only moved out when his girlfriend could because he couldn't live alone. \n\nI barely have a social life now. I have no special expenses in clothes, beauty etc because I don't really bother. I keep myself clean and presentable and that's it. I don't eat out that often. And even like this, I couldn't move out. \n\nSigning a contract for a car that I need feels like signing my death certificate. Because I know it's 4 years of stand-by. It's 4 years of nothing. And I don't know if I can survive them. The dysfunctionality of this household, the inevitable events (my dog dying for instance, or my grandparents) that will send them all spiraling and arguing to violence. I'm depressed, and overmedicated, and I have minor health issues I can't afford to have fixed. \n\nSo how do they do it? How do I do it? When every second spent doing this feels like life wasted? ",

You know the ones that are designed to be used in a straight razor: fully detachable, single sided blades that are almost as sharp as a scalpel. It wouldn’t be difficult to pull my pants down, dig a razor in and follow a major artery. After all: every nurse who’s taken my blood has always complimented my pronounced veins. It would be a nice last thought, thinking of all the compliments of such a mundane thing from such beautiful women who wouldn’t go out with me if I asked.\n\n\nI have an appointment with a psychiatrist next Wednesday, but it feels moot considering I’m probably going to lose my job tomorrow and I have no insurance.

    "title": "life ruined before it even started (Tw)",
    "selftext": "(throwaway) let’s just start off from the beginning of my life, my dad is a well known drug dealer of my area, Very abusive man to my mother before and after i was born to the point my mothers blood was dripping onto my newborns face all because he was doing drugs and smashing our houses windows. It got to the point we had to hid in woman’s recuse far away from my hometown, i was 2 years old and my first memory is trying to fight and attack my mother although she said i’ve been traumatised due to him smashing dishes before i could even understand what’s going on and im still cry and scream if someone makes a loud noise near me, don’t mean to. Then around when i was maybe 9 i had my first interaction with pornography, i genuinely think it has ruined me as a person. As i would see youtubers go on omegle and thought it would be fun to talk to people and see youtuber, turns out it was a breeding ground for people to take advantage of me and make me strip and do things for them, Being exposed to CP Of father and daughter, Being showed Gore, a family member walked in me doing that, and they said nothing. Didn’t say a word to me or anyone, why couldn’t he say something? I then lost access to omegle and started downloading dating apps to try and feel validated again, again doing things that i’ve been told. My grandmother saw the photos as it was on her device and i lied saying i was looking for my pain, terrible lie and i made them believe it because the feeling i felt when someone said they loved me felt amazing. Growing older, Getting groomed Online again such as Roblox. Discord by older men, letting them and i knew it was wrong. Same cycle happenens getting groomed by older men before having my own phone, or laptop (they was family members devices), I finally got my own phone in year 6, and the first girl in my year to get her period, as i was humiliated as apparently i wasn’t supposed to throw away my pads in the bin but flush them??? yeah okay. But then the boys started to notice, they told me they loved me. But instead of getting groomed i was getting used for pictures again, i was a virgin until i was 14 but most people knew what i looked like naked. Then it was mostly all of them because they realised how easy it was to get photos of me all because they lied and said they wouldn’t show. I know ill get called out for slutty behaviour but i never did it all at the same time (for now at least), But one after the other one said they loved me and said they would never do that and they would be different? Lies. alllll lies, then my first boyfriend ever i caught him cheating on me after i let him take my virginity?? Cheating on me with multiple woman and being toxic with me always look like the bad guy?? Now this is where everything gets worse and it’s my fault, I slept with his enemy behind his back, while on a break. I waited until he cheated on me 10times for me to do it, and i done it. Got caught, and me and him stayed together for 2 more months, with him getting more aggressive, and his older cousin started to get close to me, and i did something horrible again. He didn’t know about that though. After the breakup as we knew we wasn’t right for eachother (even though he still messages me telling me he loves me?). After that me and my dad suddenly started getting close, started doing drugs with him. Meeting his multiple girlfriends and hanging around his friends. In his 40s showing me his girlfriend who is freshly 18 but she has known him since they was 14, don’t even want to think about it because two of my dad’s friends have been outed out as pedophiles in news and around town, I used to bother with one a lot while out with my dad. But i hope everyday he isn’t a pedophile, i know ive caught him liking girls photos from my school but it could be a good reason for it. Then me and my dad got into a car crash, Not a bad one but shook me up maybe mentally i’ve been shut off for a good hour as i can’t sleep and make the decision to rant my life to the internet cause my life feels like a sand shit storm with something new everyday. A couple of months ago i went on a holiday in turkey. Long story short, My dad enjoyed me grinding on strippers at 16, Got spiked first day we got there and left me in a turkish hospital and i had no phone on me or anything, Turns out he snapped it because i was “too drunk” my only memory of that day is begging in the ambulance to them to not let me die. I think i was getting raped twice by the same guy at the bar we kept going to, First time he locked the stall do and kept me quiet, Second time dragging me away from my dad to do it again behind the shack toilet. Fact is i’m not even surprised, i tried to say no and squirm but i would rather be quiet and live. People think of me as a whore because i let one of the Popular boys brother tap when i was still in high school, My ex bsf leaked that secret not know that i tried to scream and scratch but nothing helped. And now im currently unemployed, college kicked me out because of attendance (Medical emergency happened and i had to be in a wheelchair) don’t know what’s wrong with me because the NHS hates me in particular and won’t tell me why my pain exists, I haven’t left my house to ‘see’ people was halloween and even before then i was isolating from people. What now then, I think my brain heart and intestines are hurting and my brain in a mental way and physical, Me and my best friend don’t take to eachother anymore because i started ignoring everyone. Cause i want to die? I don’t know, Too exhausted to life and to die. Can barely walk up the stairs without struggling. Amazing, 17 this year. Thank you for taking the patience to read my nonsense as i just wanted my feelings to be out somewhere.\n\nAlso does religious breakdown involve feeling the weight of my sins and i should be punished for sowing every bad i ever done ",

A grounded child that can’t come out to play lest he get punished for longer.\nEventually I always stand up and feed it again, out of desperation, out of fear, out of spite, out of necessity.\nTears rolling down my swollen, reddened face, clinging at my chin until they too, submit, feeding this horrid empty abyss.\nThis hungry, hungry well.\n",

    "selftext": "[27M] just wanted to voice my mental state\n\nI think because of the way I was brought up and all the things Ive been through. Ive found myself in a blank zone. Never really needed a therapist mostly because I could self reflect a lot and I mean A LOT. Felt like each time I did, I discarded previous me for a better me. Due to my trauma and past abuse physical/mental, my mentality has been wired to be resolute to not give in to negativity. Hence it isolated me as I became so much more comfortable in independance and my solitude. It also pushed me to regulate my emotional state to an unhealthy degree. \n\n[THE GOOD]\nMy hardships have allowed me to become the person I am today. I feel, think, understand, comprehend, and accept that there is so much life has to offer. Colorful scenery and views, the sound of nature, blue skies that cover you like a soft blanket on warm summer days, gentle rain that hugs you on lonely cold nights. Good geniune people you can find along the way. The wholesome breathe of life.  \n\n[THE BAD]\nYet in between it all, over the years Ive grown indifferent, spiteful, cynical, apathetic, cold, and distant. I think we all graduallly build these qualities with time, maybe not all but some. There are times where I wish I could just close my eyes and drift into eternal slumber. Moments where my emotions arent kept in check and I feel like I could end everything. Ive tried 4 times and nearly saw the devil on the 4th try. I appreciate the life I have but I still have moments where I feel like I could crack at anytime but im so used to being in this state for so long that im no longer phased by anything anymore. I could lose a leg, an arm, my eyes and id prob cope a lot faster than some people would. In fact I almost got impaled, almost got my right foot amuptated, and nearly died from overworking. Its bad when you look back at it thinking damn i almost died and laugh. Just secretly thinking how nice it wouldve been. Well, I dont expect or have expectations. I dont see a point in crying, screaming, or reacting emotionally in most situations people would. Ive become more selfish and less empathetic. Ive adopted the mentality that if it aint my problem, I dont care. If someone came into my room and told me i needed to run and deliver a heart to a kid in need of it, id prob tell them to f#ck off and go to sleep (unless I got paid). \n\nWell...maybe some day ill regain that compassion and empathy. Despite all the hardships, mistakes, massive f#ck ups, i think I still came out decent mental wise. \n\n",

All this voices have told me to kill myself, so are some people that were close to me. \n\nBut I can't do it. I don't want to be a burden to everyone that has to burry me, cry for me. I know that some people love me and I cannot imagine hurting them, they've been through enough already. And I dont think that I deserve the sweet liberation of death. I only deserve the pain, that's why I only cut myself, deep enough to hurt me for days, but not deep enough to liberate me from all of this.\n\nI just want my soul to be able to fly, to feel the wind, the water and the world without all this feelings. I can almost feel that I can reach that in this human form, but I'll have to turn them off, my feelings. But they are what makes me human, what makes me love. And I can tell you, I love, with all my soul and heart some things and people.\n\nBut I just feel that I'm not enough in this form, like I can do so much more, to see ao much more, but I am not able to. \n\nMostly I don't even feel like I'm human. I have vivid dreams almost every night, sometimes they are confusing me and I don't know when the reality begins and ends.\n\nI can see some things, feel some things that are not for every human eye. That scares me to, makes me feel like I'm trapped between the human part of me and the supernatural part of everything.\n\nIt's like seeing and knowing, without knowing why you do and why others don't. It's like trying to explain gravity to a two year old with some people. \nI feel crazy. \n\nAnd I feel like I'm a fraud, I cannot talk about this things with most of the people, they get scared of some of the information, they don't belive me.\n\nDo I stick to the human me or continue my path and get to see everything that others don't?\n\nIt's so strange.",

I guess where I'm going wrong is not keeping the routine. I've been going to therapy for 3 years for GAD. I see my therapist every Friday and we do talk about techniques and mindfulness for depression but it's like my body is too exhausted to fight it anymore. \n\nI noticed I only get 2 days out of the entire month where I'm okay and I crash the fuck out and it stays like this for a while.

    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with depression years ago, but I never took medication for it because I felt like I could manage it on my own. I do talk therapy and the therapist seems more interested in discussing my romantic and social life and not this huge glaring issue I need to address. Depression has always been my norm since I was a kid so I don’t know which symptoms and behaviors are indicative of my depression, but what I’m dealing with right now is the most bizarre situation I’ve ever encountered.\n\nWhen COVID hit, everything changed. I was halfway through college, and we went fully online. For two years, I barely left the house, not even for a walk. Total Isolation became my norm, and I fell into an even deeper rut. By the time I graduated and re-entered the real world, it was like my brain had just stopped working.\n\nNow, I experience these bizarre, brain-dead moments that send me spiraling into a deep depression. For example, last year I stood in front of a push door with my family on the other side, frozen and nearly in tears, saying, “I don’t know what to do.” I could see the door, I understood the concept of “push,” but my brain just wouldn’t process it. It’s not just doors, these moments pop up randomly, and I feel completely disconnected from myself.\n\nIt wasn’t always like this. Before COVID, I had the occasional “off” day, but now it feels like this is my new normal, and it’s terrifying. I’ve tried therapy, but my therapist hasn’t really done anything to help me. I feel like I’m screaming for help, and no one’s hearing me.\n\nCould depression really cause something like this? Or is it something deeper? I don’t do drugs, I hardly drink alcohol, I recently began exercising and meditating. I don’t even know how to begin fixing it, but I just want to feel like myself again. Has anyone else been through something similar?",

    "selftext": "Hello, I am new to this community and wanted to share something to see if anyone has experienced similar feelings. I am currently 21 years old and in college, studying to get into medical school. So far, I’ve struggled to make meaningful connections, and I am constantly anxious about my grades and the upcoming semester. I even experience extreme anxiety during holidays because I know that with each passing day, the next semester is getting closer, and eventually, it arrives.\n\nI also feel that I’ve lost interest in things, including college itself. In the past few semesters, I’ve consistently earned straight A’s, but now it only gives me a brief sense of relief—just enough to think, \"I made it\"—before the worry about the next semester starts again. At the same time, I’ve lost the motivation and meaning behind why I’m doing all of this. Although I’ve never seen a psychologist, I would say that I experience extreme anxiety and possibly depression.\n\nIf I were to trace when these feelings began, I’d say it was about two years ago. Around that time, my grandmother, who raised me, went through a terrible medical condition. While she recovered, she was never the same, and there’s always the lingering fear that it might happen again and take her life. These past two years, I’ve become very anxious about the passage of time, especially during the breaks between semesters. I constantly worry about getting a call while I’m in another city telling me that she has passed away or is in a critical condition. This fear has made me dread the start of new semesters because it means I have to be away from her.\n\nAt the same time, I know I have to keep moving forward in life, which is what I’ve been doing for the past two years. Even though I’m doing well academically, it feels like I’ve lost the motivation and joy that once came with success. I keep working hard to show my family results and to feel like I’m making progress, but it no longer excites me—it’s just something I do.\n\nLastly, I’ve developed a strange recurring fantasy over the past two years. While I know some people who don’t want to wake up again might have similar thoughts, mine feels different. I actually fear death deeply—I think it’s the end, and I want to live as long as possible. Instead, I fantasize about going to sleep and waking up 10 years in the past, a time when life was happier\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar or had this kind of fantasy?",

As I am a nobody, with no purpose. My struggles hold nothing unique, nothing of note, no regard for higher thinking. My yearning for suicide feels very utterly primal, or maybe it's not. I'm not sure anymore. \n\nI am the outcome of a predatory relationship, and it very quickly became an abusive one. I was naiive to it, a stupid child. I wasn't unaware of the abuse though, and had an acute awareness that divorce was around the corner. It was. When it happened i sided with the abuser. I refused to believe my father was as vile as he was painted. I went back and forth for a few years, not knowing who to trust, what to do, how to act. I was lost. Drifting in the endless sea of he said she saids, my ignorant brain was poked and prodded to see how it would react to questions of morality within my life. I often took a route of inaction. At age 16, I moved out of my mother's house, abandoning her and my four younger siblings. It was incredibly selfish. I was so, so selfish. I'm still selfish now, I haven't changed. During those two years I lived with my dad, I witnessed his cruelty firsthand. It was not a fascist household, but an almost anarchic one. Endless benders, drinking, women, bar fights that I had to clean him up from. The lies he would tell mounted. He refused responsibility. I hated him, he was everything I wanted to not be. I still became somewhat like him, drowning my own sorrows of my shitty self crafted living situation with sex. I hate sex, I was raped at 12 years old, and I've hated it ever since that, but I was addicted to it. It was the only way I could feel emotionally close to someone without having to tell them anything about me, because I hated myself. Eventually I ended up hooking up with my best friend at the time's ex-girlfriend. \n\nI eventually moved out of my dad's. Haven't spoken to him since. I feel guilty for that even though I fucking despise him. Since I moved out he's gotten on drugs, lived off unemployment, taken my mom to court, committed tax fraud, and overall been awful. I feel responsible for his constant decline. Maybe I kept him grounded. Maybe that thought is egotistical. My best friend also found out about what I did. I haven't spoken to him in over a year now. He probably hates me, I hate myself more. I've been in college for a bit over a year now, majoring in English Literature. It feels hopeless. My life is so cyclical. Obligatory Trump comment here. Everything feels so much worse every day. I think about killing myself hourly, and I'm finally done. I'm done thinking. I'm done with it all. I want so badly to die, I want so badly to be punished for everything I've done, I only deserve the worst. I am cowardly, awful, closed off, self pitying, a waste of space really. \n\nI have so much more I want to say, but not everything can have a conclusion, most things just end. ",

    "title": "I wish I wasn't trans, but atleast I got God",
    "selftext": "I've been so incredibly depressed about my existence and have been in a constant battle with myself. I'm tired, but not in a physical way. I'm tired in a spiritual way, my soul no longer wants to keep on fighting, and my body is slowly following along with its request. I sleep all the time, refuse to get a job or go outside because I've been convinced that the outside world hates me. I just don't want to show myself to anyone anymore, I hate myself and it's hard to think otherwise when I've been told by millions of strangers that they hate me. I wish I wasn't trans, I wish I had been born a man instead of a transman. I don't know why I was brought into a world that does nothing but mock and treat me like a monster.\n\nThe thing is, I've been struggling with depression my whole life. First it was because I didn't know my true identity, then it was because of family issues and bullying through every single grade. At some point it started to get better once I started my transition two years ago, but it all came crashing down once the public fear grew bigger. You know how people say \"depression tells you that everyone hates you when that's not true\"? well, tell me this. How is one supposed to ever heal and tell themselves that depression is lying- when you got millions of people on earth saying that it's true, that they DO hate you? This will never heal, I will never be able to love myself because my depression is right. it'll always be right.\n\nTherapy does not work, talking to family does not work either because they do not think it's a big deal. I always get the same responses: \"Just live your life\", \"You shouldn't care what others think\", etc. It's quite impossible to follow that 'advice' when there's constant news articles of how evil I am for existing, how a transperson was stabbed, how we're now the number one enemy in every social media, how people will approach us in the streets to say horrible things to our faces. I could go on and on.\n\nI feel lonely. I feel like I've been outcasted by my own species and it's destroying me from the inside out like cancer. I haven't taken care of myself since the start of 2024. Everyone's words got to my head, it hurts me to think someone would hold so much anger, hatred, disgust towards me for something so small, something that won't even matter once we all meet our end. Worst part is, I can never change that. I'll never be worth of respect unless I detransition, but if I detransition, I'll just be as miserable. There is no exit.\n\nMaybe I wouldn't be feeling this horribly if I knew I could atleast count on the Lgbt community, but they don't even want us anymore. I don't even know when it happened but- gay people suddenly threw us under the bus at some point and started going 'lgb without the t'. I think that's what really did it for me, knowing that we're now definitely on our own. If anything happens in the future that makes things more dangerous for us, we'll face it alone. No more community. No more empathy. Just us. I can't begin to tell you how terrible it feels to see someone who's gay saying that I am ruinning things for them, that they don't like us out of nowhere, despite everything we faced together.\n\nI also felt terrible when people I looked up to also ended up being transphobic. Harry Potter helped me through so much when I was a trans kid, it helped me cope with the bullying at school. There's a couple more celebrities who I loved who turned out to really dislike me, not just her. The worst thing is, I wish I could meet them, beg them to give me a chance to prove them that I am good.\n\nIt's kind of ironic, at first I blamed it all on God and rejected religion- blamed it for everything. Every single hurtful word thrown towards me. I blamed it all on God. But at some point in the end of 2024, I realized he was never to blame, and asked for his forgiveness. Now I truly, TRULY believe he's the only one I have left, the only one who loves me. That's what keeps me going, even if only for a bit. I came to the conclusion that he has been the only one in my life trying to help me survive. The only one left in my room with me, always by my side. Knowing he has unconditional love for me fills my weak heart with joy. That's all I want, I just want to be loved.\n\nI thought of  joining the military for a second, to atleast put my life to good use, but, yeah... that's not happening. I'm not welcomed. I'm pretty sure trans people will be banned there anyway.\n\nSo what am I gonna do with my life now that things are only gonna get worse? Well, I like to waste my time sleeping because my dreams are kinder than the real world. In my dreams I get to be an average man and no one cares. Hopefully I can sleep each upcoming year away until God says the party's over. I'm not sure if I'll survive. I used to be afraid of the idea of death, but it's gone now, it's all gone. I've never craved it this much ever in my life. And me getting closer to God and asking for forgiveness, etc, it makes me even more determined to try it. I know he'd forgive me, he understands human suffering more than anyone. I just want to be at peace for once, I want to be accepted and the only place where I'll be accepted is in his arms.",

    "title": "Struggling to Come to Terms with My Sexuality, and It’s Causing a Lot of Depression",
    "selftext": "I (male in my 20s) was born and raised in San Diego by my mom, a single mother of Korean descent (VERY abnormal for an Asian family). She had me after a hook up with a Chinese man during a tough period in her life when she was battling deep depression. Despite the challenges she faced, we were fortunate—my mom was relatively well-off, so I never felt deprived growing up (at least in a material context). My older sister, who’s eight years older than me, lost her dad to a stroke when she was little. That loss plunged my mom into a dark place, but when I came along, she found the strength to turn her life around. She eventually remarried and had my younger brother, reshaping the dynamics of our family.\n\nI grew up in a Buddhist household. While Buddhism is often portrayed as a tolerant faith, in reality it's not that much less homophobic as Christianity, at least in a Korean context. From a young age, I was a bookish, geeky kid and was always extremely feminine, which made me a target for occasional teasing. Even so, I managed to have a lot of friends and was generally well-liked. But underneath it all, I always felt different, as if I carried a secret I wasn’t ready to share—even with myself.\n\nThat difference started to take shape when I was like 10, in what I now think of as my “gay awakening.” When my older sister left for college, she left behind her collection of CDs, which I listened to obsessively. One album that stood out was No Doubt’s *Tragic Kingdom*. I was especially hooked on *Just a Girl*, dancing to it every chance I got. One day, mid-dance, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and froze. I, for lack of better words, looked extremely fruity. It nearly gave me a heart attack and shame followed suit. From that moment, I began to see my feelings as something to hide.\n\nBy middle and high school, my inner turmoil grew. I developed my first celebrety crush on Zac Efron after watching *High School Musical* (talk about cliche, yeesh, he's not even that bad tbh) and even started developing crushes on most of the guys in my classes. At the same time, my mom kept talking about how I’d eventually find a “pretty wife” and settle down. That pressure, combined with my own self-doubt, drove me to bury my feelings. I tried to “fix” myself through various methods like taking up Wing Chun (a Chinese martial art), hoping that it would serve as both a means of connecting with a culture I never knew and as a way of trying to ignite a sort of masculine fire in my soul. Didn't work and spiraled into a depression that lasts to this day that's going on at the same time I'm having an identity crisis over my racial and ethnic background too.\n\nIn college, I went to the other extreme. I became a fuckboy, bouncing from one short relationship to another with any girl who was willing, none lasting more than a few months. Deep down, I knew I wasn’t truly enjoying it (I felt things for a few chicks but like idk). I was a fucking asshole. Looking back, I realize I was desperately trying to convince myself—and everyone else—that I was straight. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t escape the truth.\n\nEventually, I started being open about my sexuality and pretending like I was ok with it on reddit and other online circles (even though I never came out to anyone irl because I have no idea what the fuck to say I am) just to see how it would feel. It felt weird because I'm honestly not ok with it. I wish I was straight. I wish I actually knew what I am. Gay? Bi? Ace? No clue. All I know is I've been playing a role since I was a kid and I'm fucking sick of it.\n\nThe hardest part is that I haven’t come out to my mom yet. I just can’t bring myself to do it. She’s been through so much—losing my sister’s dad, battling depression, and working tirelessly to hold our family together. I feel like I owe her stability, like I can’t add to her burdens. Maybe I see too much of her in myself. She used loveless sex to ignore her problems too (that's how I was born). It makes me wonder if this is some kind of generational trauma, a cycle I’m stuck in.\n\nMost days, I wish I were straight. It would be so much simpler. At least then, I’d have a clear sense of identity instead of this constant uncertainty. I feel weak, ashamed, and terrified of disappointing my mom. It’s like I’m trapped in this endless loop of guilt and confusion, and I don’t know how to break free.",

But outside of those things, I wasn't allowed to go anywhere, or hang out with anyone and it has led to me being left with absolutely no social skills and some pretty serious depression that i cant afford to talk about with a professional... At 16 I had a girl, and I convinced my mom to let me hang out with her, but it was tough and we couldn't really do anything other than watch movies and shit together, and understandably she got tired of that and how boring I was in general because I didn't have anything to talk about. So we of course broke up (she also ended up doing a bunch of super toxic shit for a while but wtv). But after we broke up, i had recently gotten a drivers license and was allowed to get a job and shit so I had more time in my day where I could be talking to people. Also not long after we broke up, I found a friend on discord. She was my first ever real friend and we got close pretty quick. Finally I wasn't going to be completely alone anymore. Sure I was still boring, but she didn't mind. \n\n\nBut now, we've been friends for almost 2 years, and I could tell recently that she's getting bored with me. Recently she hasn't been talking to me much, and I woke up this morning to her having blocked me on Instagram.. I sat pondering about what ive done wrong (quite a lot of crying was involved ill be honest)  and the only thing I can think of is just I'm boring. Or she's tired of being bothered by me cuz she's my only friend. And I've tried asking her about it before but she only talks to me like twice a day now so I always just get back a \"sorry I've been busy\". \n\n\nShe's the only friend I've ever had. I really don't know how I'll handle it if I lose her. And not that i'd ever tell her cuz thats fucked up, but she's kinda the only reason i haven't just ended it. And with the fact that i live in a small town, where everyone knows everyone, the closest city is a 3 hour drive, there's no real chance I'm gonna find another friend for a good long time. If I lose her I don't think I'll be able to go on. I've lived my whole life entirely alone, I don't think I can do it any longer.

I find myself looking for ways out, but I have guilt about disappointing the few people who saw worth in me. I just think some people were destined to have a bad life, life is unfair. Even if you’re a “good person”.  I’m tired of the torture, when I NEVER asked to be here anyways. I can’t stop having the suicidal thoughts, but I also can’t shake the guilt about it. Like do I even deserve death? Maybe I deserve to be tortured. Or maybe I was just dealt a bad hand. I can’t foresee the future, but, it’s not looking good. How could life be this dark?",

    "selftext": "This is my ever first post about my mental health, I usually wouldn't write it down, but it's 04:30 am and I feel like I need to write it somewhere. I don't mind if no one's reading this, I just need to get some stuff off my soul. \n\nRight now I'm sliding into a depressive down and I can't find anything to hold myself up with. I go to bed way too late to then sleep 10-14 hours, waking up in between but forcing myself to continue sleeping, so I can be in my dreams. \n\nIn my dreams I feel more alive than in my actual life. I dream different stories, sometimes it's like I'm in a fantasy world, sometimes it's real life but in good, sometimes it's like living a movie story and other times it's just like watching a movie. No matter what kind of dream it is, I'm getting comfort in it. So much that I hate waking up more than anything and it's making me wish to sleep forever. In my dreams I don't have this heavy feeling with me, I feel free, easy and weightless. I feel all kind of happy emotions, sometimes even sad ones, but it's always emotional. When I wake up there's just.. Nothing left at all, no emotion. Over the last months I feel more and more empty and there's nothing more scary than that. \n\nI'm a 21 years old german female student, just moved out from my family home into a city to study there, sharing the apartment with two strangers, everyone having their own room but sharing kitchen and bath. \n\nIt was always a dream of mine to someday move out and study, but at the moment I feel myself breaking apart more and more. \n\nI don't like the people living with me, one of them is even a little scary with makes it uncomfortable living here. I miss my family, even though I visit them all few weekends. I'm messing up my studying more with every day going by. I never learned how to learn and just when struggling with doing the university homework the upcoming depression hit me and I didn't go to university classes here and there, by now I'm not going anywhere anymore. I feel terrible about it but the thought of going there is scaring me even more, because the professors could ask why I wasn't there for so long. I tell my whole family that university is going well, lying to their faces, but I'm too embarrassed to say anything. \n\nI don't speak to my family about my mental health because when I did in the past the only thing that came back was \"you're exaggerating! Everyone has hard times. don't play like that!\". No one knows about my feelings, not even friends. I don't want to look pathetic, even though I am because I can't do anything right. Me messing up my studies is burdening me a lot. \n\nIt's not the first time I feel like I'm feeling right now. I once had a small depression-phase in my teen years through bullying in school and being self-conscious (the time I tried to talk to my mom about it, I wrote her answer in the other text line). \nThe other time was a huge depressive down that I just realized how deep it was after I got out of it. It was during one of my last 2 years of school before graduation. To that time I was living in a single room in boarding school, only being with my family on weekends. To that time I thought about dying a lot, standing in front of my opened window in middle of the night for hours several times, just staring out, letting my thoughts run about what would be if I actually jumped and died. I was also similar to now skipping many classes that time. The thing that slowly got me out of it was the new roommate I got, which became a good friend of mine and fixed my sleep cycle by going to bed at the same time and not leaving me enough time with my thoughts. She probably saved me. I would never have had the courage to jump, but I was already informing myself about antibiotics to sleep in forever. To that time I thought it was just \"out of interest\" but after all this I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have stayed like that. \n\nAnyways, I got off topic. \n\nI'm an introverted person, spending most of my free time in my room gaming, watching TV, hearing music & drawing stuff. Most social contacts I have are online, I only see my real life friends all few months because of distance and such. The few friends I got here are going to the same university but they study other things than me and we're also not too close. I distanced myself from them over the last weeks.\nI'm getting to know someone romantically since a few months, but they also (surprise) live far away, as I met them online first and only two times in real life. I don't even feel anything about them anymore, I don't feel anything about anything right now to be honest. The only person that makes me feel something is my mom and my sister when I hug them. When my mom drove me back here last Sunday and we hugged goodbye I just started crying for 15 minutes, excusing it as being home sick, but in reality I wasn't ready for her to leave and for me to feel absolutely nothing again. \n\nMy strategie when I felt bad in the past was to just cry it out and feel better afterwards, but besides that time now with my mom I can't even cry anymore. I want to but I just can't. About a week ago I broke down in middle of the night, I couldn't sleep in and thoughts were flooding my mind, the wish to wake up in another world and I was begging the universe to fullfill me the dream of a reset in a new world. I cried out my soul that night till I finally sleeped. \n\nThe issue is that I feel how things are getting worse and I don't know how to fix it. \nLast weekend when I was with my family I couldn't even enjoy my time there. My mom and I planned to go to wellness on one day, my grandma had birthday the other day and on the last day it was planned to go to an indoor park with my little niece. I was so excited for it before, but then it was all gone and I just pretended to be sick, not having the strength to go to any of the events I usually love so much. Instead, on one day I just sleeped for 16 hours. \n\nI don't get the motivation for the smallest things, not even gaming is bringing me joy right now. I just began to get lost in anime series and my Nintendo dating sim game, as sad as it sounds, it's at least giving me the possibility to run away into another world at least for some time. \n\nTopic love: I wish I'd finally find someone who's clicking with me because no matter who I met, no one seems to be the right one. I don't fall in love anymore, I don't even have anyone to fall in love with. When I freshly started university I actually did try to get to know people, even though I'm introverted I tried to be brave and go and talk to people first, but no one seems to have interest to talk to me. I don't get why it is so hard to just find a friend who's getting more with time. Someone to just enjoy some free time with, play games, watch movies, go out on many dates, just enjoying the company and conversations. Why is it so hard? \n\nIn my dreams I often find love and enjoy time with them, in some dreams I already have a family, a husband and kids. This imagination is beautifully comforting, it's always been my goal and it hurts me how far away it is in real life. \n\nWell, I began writing this when it was 04:30 am, now it's exactly 05:30 am. I could go on with writing endlessly. This doesn't feel too bad but terrible at the same time when I think that usually I'd have classes at 08:00 am and how I won't go there again. I already see myself sitting in my bed most of the day, scrolling through Reddit, tiktok, reels and other brain destroying shit instead of being at uni. Pathetic. \n\nI'm trying to get some control back by having my alarm clock on 10:00 am, but I can't guarantee for it because I'm just getting all weak when I'm having a good dream and the alarm rings. \n\nAnalysis of myself for now:\nI'll either somehow get my ass up and save some classes by max effort zero motivation, forcing myself to social contacts besides that...\nOr I'll probably end up dead by pills in a half year/year. I don't think about dying too much yet, but I know the stress will only increase the closer the exams get, because as soon as I fail them my family will know too and I can't explain them why things happened, so dying isn't that bad of an alternative after all. Maybe I'll actually spawn in a new world, the typical anime reincarnation dream, dropping in an ideal anime. \n\nLol, I'm getting stupid by how late it is, so I'll stop writing here. \nGreetings if anyone actually did read that, I'll probably delete this whole thing tomorrow.

    "selftext": "It came from nowhere in particular, one day it just appeared. \n\nWell it didn't actually appear, it just made itself known. Sort of. \n\nHow can I describe it? \n\nIt's like, that feeling you get, when you drop a glass or something. Something delicate or precious.\n\nOr, when you go up stairs and you miss one, or maybe you take an extra step that isn't there. You know, THAT feeling. \n\nWell anyway, it's like that, but a bit different. It's similar, but maybe not as severe, and it last for ages. All day sometimes. Maybe days. Sometimes weeks. \n\nBut not even just that \n\nSometimes, it's this feeling, as though you KNOW something really bad is about to happen, or could happen, right this next second. So you get ready. THEN, nothing happens. \n\nRepeat. Repeat. Repeat. \n\nIt didn't come alone either! \n\nThat feeling brought one of its mates with it. Maybe even a cousin or its brother, I don't know if feelings have families. \n\nThis other one is WAY worse, i think. \n\nDepends who you ask. Some people get both, some get one or the other, some lucky people get none. I guess they're two sides of the same leaf or whatever. \n\nThis other one's awful. \n\nIt's as though sadness has been magnified. Then, you mix it with tiredness. But it's your WHOLE body. And it hurts too. Sort of. It hurts your chest and your stomach, inside your head and even your eyes. \n\nIt hurts your throat and your nose too, because sometimes it feels like you're going cry. But you don't cry. At least I don't. Some people cry loads. My cry is broke though.\n\nSaying that, sometimes it actually feels like NOTHING. You can't feel anything. Not happy, not angry, not sad. Just nothing. No matter how hard you try.\n\nI don't know which one's worse. Because  they can both last such a long time. \n\nYou know what's really shit too? you can't point them out to anyone. So, some people don't believe they're real. But they are. Ask anyone who knows. \n\nSome people try to cut it out of themselves sometimes, I know I tried. Doesn't work. Don't recommend that strategy either. \n\nThen, these clever head-doctors, they said \"take these of a morning\". Well I do, and that kind of helps in a way, but these feelings are still there. They're just a bit different now. Sadness magnified, but with a stupid disguise on, or maybe even those rubber shoes with holes in. Holes for the bloody misery to leak out of.\n\nI could try and use all the words, but I still don't think I could do it justice. It's horrible. It's tiring, no, exhausting. It's excruciating. It's just bad. Take my word for it. \n\nAnyway, I hope you don't REALLY understand this. \n\nI hope you just get the general idea. \n\nIt's about mental health. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.\n\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\n\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.\n\nIt's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.\n\nMore than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything.

    "selftext": "Update:\n\nSorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. \nI really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \n\nI’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\n\nNext I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. \n\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \n\nI’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \n\nI’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \n\nI’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \n\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \n\nIt just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. \n\nIt’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\n\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",

Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.\n\nThe kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of \"you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there\", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.\n\nI've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.\n\nAnd with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.\n\nI wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.\n\nEdit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",

    "selftext": "Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.\n\nPicture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.\n\nI have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.\n\nThe woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to \"covid.\" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am \"allowed\" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.\n\nEventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.\n\nI decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.\n\nI am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.\n\nI dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.\n\nEdit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you.",

    "selftext": "As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.\n\nSo my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.\n\nThis is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.\n\nEdit: I don't know what to say right now...

    "selftext": "A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. \n\nI thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. \n\nHere's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me \"not having enough social activity\", as \"not having enough will\", and have called my therapy \"a waste of time.\" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. \n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all,\nWell I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.\nI’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.\nI grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.\n So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.\nWhen I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.\nWe kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.\nThen when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.\nBut we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.\nWe graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.\nWhen I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.\nWe were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.\nEveryone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.\nI felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.\nWe were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.\nWe were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.\nIt was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.\nOn Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.\nIt’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).\nI cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.\nSince I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.\nI haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.\nI feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.\nHer parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.\nPeople tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.\nJust before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.\nThe only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).\nI’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.\nI feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",

Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I\nmessed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head.",

This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. \n\nSo here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.\n\nI would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night.

This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   \n\n\nI presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage.

    "selftext": "I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. \n\nI can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. \n\nThere isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. \n\nI’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. \n\nLove doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.\n\nI tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. \n\nEven the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. \n\nMy mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.\n\nAll this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. \n\nMy only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.\n\nEdit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.\n\nI really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood.",

I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. \n\nI don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny!

I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. \nI truly appreciate it.",

    "selftext": "The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied \"200 km/h\".\n\nI have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.\n\nI drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\n\nThe everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It's a miracle you're alive\". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\n\nIf anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.\n\nPlease help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.\n\nHere are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:\n\n\\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?\n\n\\-How can I keep up or have more energy?\n\n\\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)\n\n\\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression\n\n\\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?\n\n\\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?\n\n\\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: more questions\n\nEdit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.",

I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.",

I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. \n\nEver since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.\n\nMy 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.\n\nThen he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an \"ass whooping mood\" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.\n\nI'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.\n\nCan they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.\n\nHe doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\\*\\*\\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.\n\nWhat will the cops do about it when they come?",

How FUCKED UP I am.\n\nI've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.\n\nMy family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: \"this too shall pass\", \"believe what you want to believe\" \"if you believe it won't happen, it won't.\" Yeah, great. Thanks for the \"help.\" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.\n\nI am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.\n\nAll I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go \"that sucks, pass the apple juice\", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.\n\nI don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.\n\n**EDIT: I'm seeing a therapist online.**\n\n**EDIT 2: I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments... I truly don't know what to say. I wasn't expecting this to get so much traction, and I'm so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and...** ***care***. **I'll try and respond to everyone when I can. Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.**\n\n**EDIT 3: Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are.

    "selftext": "I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.\n\nI had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to \"reason\". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, \"I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him.\" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, \"Okay, night.\" \n\nMy niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for \"keeping things going\", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.\n\nThen, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, \"I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house.\" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, \"I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?\" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.\n\nFinally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, \"Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life.\" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm \"letting it bother me\" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, \"If you get a job, you'd have more money.\" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, \"That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly.\" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more \"realistic\" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not \"getting a life\" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the \"therapy friend\" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. \n\nAnd go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for \"checking up on her\" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?\n\nI don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get \"advice\" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these \"sessions\", lol.",

I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. \n\n\nI am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. \n\n\n\n {My thoughts on my father}\n\n{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. \n\nBut you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}\n\n\n {my thoughts on my brother}\n\n{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. \nWhen I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. \n\n\nLet me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. \n\nGet to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.\n\nHaving already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. \n\n\nThe next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.\n\n(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) \n\nAnyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}\n\nThis whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. \n\n {my thoughts on my mother}\n\n{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. \n\nA few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. \n\nSo this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history\n\n(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )\n\nAnd then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. \n\nIn regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. \n\nMy father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}\n\n\n\n {thoughts on my own disgusting self}\n\nIt’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. \n\n\nI know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. \n\n\nAnd that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. \n\nWhen I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. \n\nBut as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. \n\n\nFast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. \n\nThat’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. \n\nBut here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) \n\nIt wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. \n\nBut since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. \n\nI’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.\n\nI’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. \n\n\nI doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. \n\n\n\nTLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",

Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on.",

I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. \n\nAnyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we \"to cool off,\" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. \n\nAnyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. \n\n\nEDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing.

    "selftext": "I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.\n\nSo just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. \n\nAt that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. \n\nAnd even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more \"This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel\" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. \n\nThanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.",

I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.\n\nI always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much.

    "title": "I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.",
    "selftext": "First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. \n\nAbout me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. \n\nMy life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. \n\nI grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)\n\nIn the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. \n\nAfter he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. \n\nUnfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).\n\nAfter the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. \n\nShortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. \n\nWith my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. \n\nHe also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. \n\nGenerally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.\n\nHe somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. \n\nHis last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. \n\nHowever I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).\n\nIn general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).\n\nAbout me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. \n\nUnfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). \n\nI wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. \n\nThen I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. \n\nI started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.\n\nI have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. \n\nMy ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. \n\nI had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.\n\nI had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.\n\nI then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. \n\nWhen I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.\n\nAlso this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. \n\nMy job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. \n\nIn addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. \n\nI discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. \n\nI have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. \n\nI generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. \n\nI also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.\n\nI must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under \"joke addiction or Moria\". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. \n\nConclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? \n\nI am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). \n\nEDIT: \n\nFirst of all, thank you all! \n\nYou have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. \n\nYou don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! \n\nI don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! \n\nBesides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! \nOf course, I will also seek professional help. \nIt is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! \nI know I can't change my past but I can change my future!\n\nMy inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.\n\nThanks again you are great!\n\nAND STOP PLS GIVING ME REWARD SAVE YOUR MONEY ☺️❤️",

Even though I realize how ridiculous this is, my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person, worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself. \nThis has begun to affect my concentration and I've been losing sleep.\n\nI was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?\n\nThank you in advance. I'd be appreciative of any advice I can get ;-;\n\nEdit: Guys, ty, ty, thank you for the support ;-; ❤️!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said, starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails, I will seek therapy. Good night guys, I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings\n\nEdit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought, honestly I had no idea either! There's some great advice on here guys and I'll make sure to read back on it if I ever start to doubt myself again.

    "selftext": "UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.\n\nOriginal post:\nSeriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.\n\nEdit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. \n\nEdit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.\n\nThanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.\n\nEdit 3: If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists.",

    "selftext": "Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.\n\nEdit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nWe try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under \"Community Info\" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). \n\n*****\n\nSorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under \"Community Info\" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  \n\nI'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's \"report\" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  \n\n*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   \n\n* \"I'm here to help\" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  \n\n* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  \n\n**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. \n\nIf you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  \n\nThanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.

    "selftext": "EDIT: Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3\n\nI know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. \n\nMy parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.\n\nMy friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.\n\nIt's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.\n\nSchool is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying \"mental health matters guys!\" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say \"its really important we look after our wellbeing\" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and \"talking to someone\", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to \"look after our wellbeing\" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.\n\nI have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.\n\nTheres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",

She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  \n\nHowever, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a \"great therapist.\"\n\nThis therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the \"tough love\" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was \"beyond unprofessional\" and that I should \"drop her immediately.\" \n\nI actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. \n\nI was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?\n\n*LIL' UPDATE*\n\nWow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   \n\nI have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.\n\nWith that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. \n\nThank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.\n\nI suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.\n\nI also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou hold the suns warmth in your hand\n\nwhen you touch me I become your man\n\nto be thawn is not easy\n\nthe cold bites and doesn't feel right\n\nif you've been frozen for all these years\n\na layer of ice to cover the wounds\n\nyou melt my heart you melt my soul\n\nunlocks life and a whole new world\n\nI love you with all my power\n\neven though I never told you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith the sun's rays dawns a new day\n\nbut there was something you didn't want to say\n\nfor cold winds can troubble a flame\n\nyou wanted to tell but not to hurt\n\nwhen the warmth had gotten so weak\n\nyou said that it was I who had ended the day\n\nthat the frost and ice had put out your flame\n\nyou left no please stay\n\nfor a sun needs fuel and a spark\n\na chill needs only a coffin",

He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. \n\nBitch, I’m not fucking fine. \n\nThere were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  \n\nMy favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”\n\nI’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.\n\n\nEdit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool. \n\nPlease stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol",

Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.\n\nAfter doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. \n\nI am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. \n\nI've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. \n\nI am not a quitter nor will I ever be. \n\nAll I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? \n\n\n\nJust needed to rant and vent a little.

She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic.

My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say \"Your family will be sad\" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to \"Pray that I get better\" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I'm sorry.",

She was my soul mate, we connected instantly when we met at work. I had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didn't date until a year later. But we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating.. but I knew by then that she was the one.  She understood me like nobody else and I understood her.  She was good at everything I struggled with and I was good at everything she struggled with. We never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything serious.We were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married.  But we decided to go visit my family's cabin in the mountains with some friends, and on the way home my truck broke down. We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.  In those few seconds I lost my future and my other half. I feel so alone and don't really want to live anymore. I can't see a future without her in it, the thought never even once occurred to me.Because I know she was truly my soul mate, and I will never find anyone like her. I miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing, I miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed. I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do. And I want to believe that she is in heaven looking down on me but why would God take such a beautiful and loving girl away from me. I wish I had saved her, I wish I had jumped in front of her so I was gone and she could still be here.",

I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, \"You don't understand!\" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely.

You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on.

    "title": "Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length",
    "selftext": "Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice\n\nI live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.\n\nMy grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a \"perfect\" \"son\" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.\n\nAs you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.\n\nMy step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. \n\nI want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over \"no one really cares about you\" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships\n\nBut what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem\n\nAll of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. \"No one really cares\" \n\nI feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult \n\nI'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from \"I hate myself and want to die\" to \"I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born\". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",

Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries.

People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to \"be practical\" and to \"stop being dramatic\" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for \"keeping going\" is just \"because you have to.\" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.\n\nEdit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it. I knew I wasn't the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone.

The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.\n\nThis all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the \"help\" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.\n\n\nEdit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about.

    "selftext": "Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?\n\nEdit: update and more info. \nYou guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.\n\nWe learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn’t saying much and didn’t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.\n      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn’t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.\n   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. \n   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk “I don’t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do”. He’s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. \n   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. \n   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !",

    "selftext": "My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. \n\nMy brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. \n\nI don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. \n\nTherapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. \n\nI can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. \n\nI think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. \n\nI don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. \n\nI can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...\n\nI've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... \n\nMy motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. \n\nOccasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. \n\nSome days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. \n\nEvery day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. \n\nThe best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. \n\nEverything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. \n\nMy life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...\n\nHe begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. \n\nHe sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. \n\nHe would say to me \"if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die\"\n\nI had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.\n\nHe wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered\n\nHe was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you everyone for the words and suggestions. I have read over each one multiple times. It helps. Sometimes the words from strangers and people traversing through similar waters helps. I will continue to read these. Thank you",

    "selftext": "My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. \n\nI now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. \n\nMy family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. \n\nI can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.\n\nI looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. \n\nMy mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. \n\nThe night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city. \n\nI want to let every one know that no matter what, cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously. Never forget that that may be the last time you’ll see them.",

You can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff ( I started working on myself, meditating reading more, trying to excercize, damn I've started painting watercolor. I don't how we do it, but we always find away to misinterpret one another in my family, assuming the worst in the other, we lack communication (but isn't that something to blame on the parent for not initating it in childhood?)

I know I won't do it, but man these thoughts, they stick around once they hold onto you, don't they? It's different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you don't want to deal with anymore. I don't know, it lacks the self-pity.

    "selftext": "**EDIT:** I'm so sorry guys. I spent an hour responding to more comments, only to have to delete them because I was mistakenly posting from my main account.\n\nNonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told \"things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience\"-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a \"depressed\" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.\n\nI was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with \"emotional disturbances\", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a \"friend\" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....\n\nWhile I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me \"we are not financially stable yet\". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.\n\nTurns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say \" I didnt think you'd ever find that\" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough \"homemaker\". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..\n\nWhile in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...\n\nUntil 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she \"heard\" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............\n\nOf course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......\n\nAnd then, I got Covid and almost died from it.\n\nIt's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so \"tired\" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....\n\nThese are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........\n\nCan anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that \"things will get better\"? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I've realised how fucked up my head was when I was depressed and now I see how much more light there is. But there are times that my thoughts wander and I start having those all consuming negative thoughts and suicidal ideation. Im aware though that I'm not actually depressed now. It's like I'm neither here nor there, I'm never really happy or never really sad. And I kind of miss being depressed. I miss the comfort of knowing there's nothing truly ahead of me and the inevitable death. Does this make sense to anyone? Do you have those types of thoughts as well?",

I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues.  I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  I can't thank you all enough for the unwavering support.  thank you all so much. <3",

I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days",

    "selftext": "This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.\n\nEveryone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. \n\nThankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. \n\nMy mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. \n\nI zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. \n\nMy mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. \n\nI also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.\n\nI struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. \n\nI’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. \n\nI know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. \n\nIt won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. \n\nI feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. \n\nAlso, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.\n\n\nEdit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I’ll leave it up :)",

I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)\nI just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",

    "selftext": "First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.\n\nNext I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.\n\nNext I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.\n\nNext I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. \n\nI'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.\n\nI'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.\n\n\nPS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain \"myself\" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through \"losing\" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)",

I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back.

My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.\n\nI Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.\n\nEdit. I never thought my post would get this much attention. I watched a youtube about suicidal thoughts and the guy said reddit helped him so i thought i would give this a try.I thank you all for the comments",

    "selftext": "I’ve been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse. In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it’s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it’s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven’t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people’s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I’m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don’t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents’ best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. \nI talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can’t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it’s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  \n\nI really want to die as a revenge to them, they don’t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it’ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn’t a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?\n\nI have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don’t think anything will help me out. I’m just super suicidal I cry all day, I want to end everything but I hate my mom’s sad face and crying.",

His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. \n\nWe have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him \"Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up.\" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. \n\nHe's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. \n\nMy brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.\n\nI also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. \n\nWhat do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?",

There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way.

It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does.

Life inherently sucks and requires too much time and energy. The worst thing I hate about life is that I used to go to bed more or less due to whatever responsibilities I had at the time. Now I sleep because all of the work required of me throughout the day has made me tired. \n\nI just want to be asleep forever. Nothing makes me smile anymore. I am tired of people, but I have to keep dealing with them every minute of every day. Nothing in this world can make up for that hell. I want to sleep forever.",

    "selftext": "I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   \n\nI've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  \n\nI'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. \nI can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.\nI don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  \n\nI've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.  \n\nThanks for reading all this.  I love you.",

    "selftext": "I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.\n\n\nI remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.\n\n\nI can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. \n\n\nI’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.\n\n\nEdit: wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this  but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It’s been a difficult path, I’ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven’t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation. I’ll be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as I possibly can",

The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.\n\nIm just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.\n\nForgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.\n\nEdit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock. You all are so nice and lovely...it definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that I'm allowed to be upset.

Like hello?!\n\nI ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)\n\nNow I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)\n\nThe clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)\n\nThis is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.\n\nI’m so proud of myself!\n\nFeels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me!

It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.\n\nI know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me.

She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.\nIn the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.\nDuring my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.\nI demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.\nWhen she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.\nMy daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.\nI have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live.

    "selftext": "I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.\n\nCurrently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.\n\nI’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.\n\nMy sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.\n\nI was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”\n\nCreative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.\n\nI didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.\n\nI literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.\n\nI didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.\nI didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.\n\nI just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.\n\nMy family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.\n\nI am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.\n\n\nFeelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.\n\nI am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.\n\nTL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...\n\nEdit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me\nI know it’s hard and I know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. Well get through it",

When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......\nLost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.\nThe issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. \nSo, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.\nBUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. \nOk, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.\nHave a good day.

I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what \"constructive discharge\" means that is what seems to be happening at work.\n\nSo anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.\n\nI really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.\n\nI gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.\n\nthanks",

    "selftext": "I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.\n\nEarlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.\n\nShe decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. \n\nThen the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. \n\nWe got various excuses throughout the night. \"I got sick\", \"Stuff has come up\", \"car isn't starting\", \"No babysitters\", \"My boss just called me in\". \n\nMy wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). \n\nI don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, \"Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative.\" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. \n\nIf I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.\n\nEdit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",

Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.\n\nSo, last week, I made a decision.

The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?\n\nI did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.\n\nI've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down.

Or the fact that I drank too much last night. Or that I was self deprecating all day. Or because I spoke/acted on impulse and suffered the consequences. While I still have very bad anxiety, my medication has started effectively dampening it. I’ve also started having fewer ideations in general, and I’ve been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better. I stopped drinking almost completely (I sometimes have one/month), when my friends do illicit activities I opt out, I’ve taken away specific triggers, I’ve found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule. But I’m noticing that by doing all of these “good” things I am starting to feel worse, because despite everything I am still depressed. I cannot stand in a single place doing nothing without feeling it. I can’t go to work without feeling it. I can’t have a day off without feeling it. And it’s causing some of the worst thoughts to start coming back, except this time I don’t have a crutch, and I still don’t have any motivation or hope for the future. Is there anybody here who has gotten better after trying to reroute their life? Is it possible?",

Or to change my perspective.\nNone of these have worked cause at the end of the day I’m still facing the same bullshit that is my life and struggling to catch a break. I work from the moment the sun comes up all the way into the night. School hasn’t done anything for me or propelled me forward in life. \n\nThat’s life but I’m supposed to pretend it’s ok when I’m clearly not ok?? I’m stuck in this stupid cycle hoping something will come around just to be denied something good because “that’s life and the time will come eventually.” Eventually as in probably not within my life time. I feel so hopeless and it’s ridiculous to subject myself to these thoughts. I haven’t had a moment where I can just be without the day having the be in preparations for work and school. \n\nRecently I’ve gotten a haircut which completely destroyed my self image. I’m such an idiot because I did it out of impulse and imagined that it would look good on me. \nI feel like people are lying when they say it looks good because I end up having to explain the whole reasoning behind cutting my hair with some made up bullshit like “it was damaged and extremely unhealthy” then they give me unsolicited advice on what I should’ve done with my hair. That just confirms they were lying because if it was truly fine then there shouldn’t be a “what I should’ve done instead.” \nI don’t want to go out any more or show my face to anyone that may know me because I already had this same stupid conversation about my new hair so many times as work already and a few acquaintances who clearly don’t look at me the same way anymore cause I look ugly now. \nI just wanted to look good for once but did something stupid. \nI don’t like looking at my reflection and I wake up disappointed because I look different and happier in my dreams. \n\nGod. This sucks so much. I feel so alone and trapped. Don’t even want to go outside and my self esteem is in the basement under bedrock. So fucking stupid ",

Last month, I went to his city and asked him if he wants to hang out and he still didn't reply. I know he is alive but just didn't reply my messages.
