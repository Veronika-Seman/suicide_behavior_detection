post_00001,"i have pretty bad dyslexia, but for the first time as an adult i've read 3 full books since the beginning of august! 3 whole books! i have no one to tell, because it's not really an achievement, but to me it feels like a big deal, the highlight of my year. no one around me really seems to care, because if we are being honest, it's not really that big a deal, especially because i am a grown man of 31yrs old. 
but to me this has been such an invigorating achievement!
  
  
 all my life i have struggled with my reading, comprehension and learning. it's not that i cannot read, i can, it's just that it always feels like a huge chore, i get mixed up at times and have to re-read, and wherever possible i always avoid reading out loud, as some how i get things muddled up in my head and never read things accurately. i made my way through my school days always messing up and being teased and laughed at because of the slow pace of my reading. because of this i made a big effort to make sure that as best i could i would never allow my professional career to be effected, i wanted to insure that all my emails and work would be of the highest standard, i wouldn't allow myself to look stupid as an adult. which for the most part i have been able to do, but a quick glance at my posts and comments will show that i am still prone to mistakes, which of course on reddit means you are totally spell and grammar checked instantly and belittled if you slip up. reading even on here mostly feels like work, it takes my brain a large amount of extra effort to accurately read anything, i get ""strain"" headaches and quickly tire when reading, even if it's short titles on posts. 
 
 
so for me reading has never been my idea of fun or enjoyable, it's always been a step towards learning or work and i've never gotten beyond that with my attempts at reading for pleasure. i am a big fan of military history and of medical study to do with emergency medicine or first aid, i even studied at becoming a paramedic for a short time before my study opportunity was abruptly ended. so in a way i find those subjects the easiest to begin to read in. one of the first books i've ever read that wasn't because of study or school, was the diary of anne frank, it took me 2yrs to finish cover to cover, but i was 17yrs old and it was my first ever book away from school and i still felt accomplished! i found a series of books, 4 in total that were first hand fictional stories based around the real conquest of genghis khan, imagined stories about his planning and conversations etc. i took me 7yrs to complete the books, but at 26yrs i decided that recreational reading wasn't for me. at age 29 after watching the series band of brothers for about the 50th time, i brought myself major richard ""dick"" winters book, recounting the events of wwii from his vantage point. it combined my love of military history with my love of the tv series, and over a 6 month period i read the book. but it still really really took so much effort. 
 
 
now with covid-19 effecting everything, and a prolonged bout of severe illness on top of my disability, combined with a less than ideal living situation and battling my chronic depression after attempted suicide earlier in the year, i found myself with a tremendous amount of time, isolated in my tiny bedroom bored out of my mind which was further whittling at my mental health. i picked up a book entitled sas: ghost patrol, which was a historic telling of the very beginnings of the sas fighting with a special unit known as the long range desert group, who specialised in crazy daring deadly raids on the nazis in northern africa during wwii, and focused on a hugely brave and bold attack on a nazi port of tobruk. i began reading, and soon i was realising that i was reading well into the early hours of the night, night after night! and just like that i had finished the book, in less than 3 weeks! i had actually thoroughly enjoyed it! then i picked up the next, and then the next and soon within a short 8+/- weeks i had completed 3 books, three entire books read and most crucially enjoyed! i am so excited and proud of myself! i just had to tell someone. i have just picked up my next booked entitled ""march battalion by sven hassel""!  thank you for listening.
 
 
 
edit: wow! this has blown up far beyond what i ever thought possible! thank you so so much to everyone for sharing such kindness and support! it's a bit overwhelming. i have tried and will try to get a reply to everyone who comments, but incase i don't i hope no body is upset, because there is hundreds of comments and i am struggling to read them all in a timely fashion! also a big big thank you to everyone for the awards, i received my first platinum award today, which is just wow! thank you! 

also i've found a link to a website with simulates what it can be like for those of us with dyslexia or other learning difficulties when trying to read. [dyslexia simulator](http://geon.github.io/programming/2016/03/03/dsxyliea)",1
post_00006,"it does not make sense for me to want to die. i have no history of trauma. the only slightly bad thing that has ever happened to me is that my mother abandoned me when i was a baby, but i had my wonderful grandmother who stepped into that role, and i could not have asked for anyone better to raise me. i have friends who love and care about me. i have a job with steady and reasonable pay, and even my coworkers like me and talk to me every day. i am a student at a great college, which i am on mental health leave from, but i am free to return whenever i want. 


there is so much good in my life, so much going for me, that it feels like a slap in the face to people with actual problems that i want to throw that all away. so what that my grandma and my dad hate that im trans? there are people who get kicked out onto the streets for that. i should just get over myself and not care whether they use a damn pronoun or not. why should it matter that my dad is mean to me? people have fathers that beat and rape them, and my relationship with mine was good up until a few years ago. 

logically i know that suicidal thoughts are a symptom of depression, so that should make it easier for me to overcome them. its not really what i want, just my brain telling me its what i want. so why am i still planning to kill myself on sunday? why would i let a disorder take my life when it has so much promise? but i cant make myself care about any of it anymore. i dont care about my future. its selfish, but i barely even care about leaving everyone behind anymore. im not special and im not that good of a person, so they should be able to move on just fine. i know it will hurt, but i dont contribute much to anything. im lazy and a little stupid. 


my best friend wished me a happy birthday today and said they love me and theyre glad im here. my reaction was to feel sad that there are people who love me so much that theyd be utterly devastated if i died, and it frustrated me that i cant kill myself guilt free. what kind of person thinks like that? someone so selfish they dont even deserve to be alive. my friends and family deserve someone better who wouldnt even dream of leaving them behind like that. so does my cat. i tried writing out a note and individual texts for everyone, and there were so many to do that it got overwhelming, so what does that say? 

the one thing making me hesitate is that it will hurt or that it wont work and ill just end up in a psych ward again. usually i skip the step of attempting and just check myself in for a while because oding isnt that great of a method in terms of reliability and pain. those times i knew i didnt really want to die. i just wanted help and for things to get better. but im very tempted to try on the off chance that i can get it right. i couldnt conceptualize death back then like i can now. im pretty sure it wouldnt feel like anything, and thats what i long for. i dont want to exist. i want to feel nothing. 

there must be some hope for me because i decided to stay alive long enough to turn 22 and to watch timothe chalamet on snl, so maybe i can try sticking it out even beyond that. i counted my grandmas blood pressure pills, and i read that a man died taking about half of the amount i have access to, so im pretty sure if i actually had the guts to do it, it could work. it would be very unpleasant, im sure, but it probably would get the job done. 

if anyone actually read all of this, thanks for listening, and i hope you stick around to find out if life has better things to offer. very hypocritical of me to say, but i mean it.",1
post_00011,"tomorrow i'm going to get help  tomorrow i'm going to wake up and wait until my house is empty, im going to sit on the floor with my favourite knife and mark the arteries on my wrists with a pen. i've dreamed of actually slicing and bleeding out and finally being free but i wont be doing this tomorrow. tomorrow i will get help.

i'll call an ambulance and tell them what i plan to do, the operator will stay on the phone with me until the ambulance arrives and i'll be sectioned. i'll be helped. 

i know lots of people will think that sounds even worse but i promise u id be happier in a psychiatric ward than my current life. 

i guess ill update?",1
post_00016,"passive suicidal thoughts are taking over my life. i'm 21, just graduated from college, and i am so ready to stop existing. i think about suicide pretty much all day everyday. i don't think i would ever act on it, but i think about it every second of the day. every inconvenience that happens every day makes me think about wanting to die. i don't have active plans but i think often about what it would be like to disappear or die. i want an escape so badly. life feels so heavy. these thoughts are overtaking me, yet they are somehow my only escape. 

i'm not sure why i am posting this, but i just felt like i had to get it out. i haven't shared this with anyone in my life because i am afraid my family will think i'm just being dramatic. i've struggled with depression for most of my life and i am on zoloft, but i've never felt this bad. any support would be greatly appreciated.",1
post_00022,"my friend is coming for my cat this weekend the only thing worth living for is my beautiful baby freya. i'm about to be evicted and she is about to be picked up by my friend so i can just die alone. she's going to be taken care of and that's what matters but i can't stop crying and she knows something is wrong. i just can't be homeless with her. she deserves better. 

when she's gone, i'm going to leave to. i can't live without her. ",1
post_00025,"anyone elses suicidal thoughts get triggered by the smallest things?. i dont even want to write out the small things that happen because they sound so stupid when i look back on them, but 9 times out of 10 they just result in me crying and wanting to die maybe im just weak and pathetic",1
post_00026,"i just overheard my mom talking on the phone when i came out to my mother as gay (13 years ago), she handled it very poorly. understandably so - she grew up baptist in a small alabama town in the 60s where there was not a lot of diversity. there were a lot of angry words between us, a lot of hurt, and it took a long time for us to repair our relationship. 

while she still doesn't like to talk a lot about homosexuality (and i'm not totally out to all of her friends to save us both the headache), she supports me wholeheartedly and treats my girlfriend like another daughter and it's wonderful. 

tonight i overheard her on the phone talking to a friend of hers and, while the conversation was (obviously) one-sided on my end, i could piece together the situation:

her friend found out that his child is gay and he is *not* happy about it. but after a few minutes, i heard my mom say, ""charlie, do you want your child to be miserable pretending to be straight or do you want her to be in a happy, loving relationship? no, we don't necessarily get the younger generations. things are a lot different now. but i would much rather my daughter be able to be happy and honest with herself than live a lie. [more conversation followed, but that was the best part].""

it really took me back. my mom is still really conservative around her conservative friends, and she doesn't really speak up that often about things like this. it made me really proud of her, her growth, and our relationship. 13 years ago i wasn't sure if i'd ever have a healthy relationship with my mother ever again, and tonight i heard her stand up for someone else's gay daughter. 

and while she couldn't be that woman 13 years ago, she was that woman tonight. and it's just so awesome. i love her so much.

edit: wow, guys! i had no idea this would gain momentum like it has, but after reading some of your comments and some of your stories i understand why. 

i just wanted to say that some of us seem to be very lucky with our parents who surprised us, and i hate to see that some of you are still in the closet out of fear of your parents' response or had a terrible experience coming out. 

what helped me when i was 18 and my mom and i weren't on good terms was to build my own family for support. it helped that i'd moved away to college and had new friends in a new town; they really helped me while i was essentially estranged from my mom. 

and when i came out to my mom i expected the worst and that's what i got. at 31 now, i wouldn't have taken that response off of anyone and would definitely cut them out of my life. but my dad died when i was 13, and my mom and i really aren't close with the rest of our family. i think we both realized that we're really the only one each other can rely on. 

a few years ago, i was in a terribly abusive relationship with another woman and my mom and i still weren't on the best of terms. i had to move home to get away from that partner and spend a few months in therapy to fix the damage she caused. it was then mom told me that it didn't matter who i loved. it mattered that i was a good person and that i lived with the values that my dad had instilled in me. i think she saw how dark of a place i was in and she was afraid of losing me, and that helped her come to the realization that i was still her daughter and she wanted me to be happy, and that was more important than who i was attracted to. that was really the turning point in our relationship to get it back on track. 

all that to say, some of your parents may never change. and i'm really sorry for that and i hope you can build a new family. but some times parents really can surprise you, and you never know what the catalyst might be for them. 

i appreciate all of your comments and kind words towards my mother; i'm so glad some people can respect and value her growth where her conservative friends probably would not. she's still very conservative in some aspects, but since she's been able to accept me she's started coming around in a lot of other ways too. i probably won't mention this post to her because she's a very private person lol. but i know if she wasn't, she'd appreciate everything you all said.",1
post_00044,"our support is crap. i have never felt loved, or known. i'm a gender fluid, pansexual teenager with highly religious parents. my father isn't here, and my mother hates me.

i can't tell them i'm pan, and even if i did, they'd make me feel ashamed. my friends at school know, but i feel like i make them uncomfortable with it.

i'm a horribly toxic, and narcissistic friend. i laugh at others suffering because for some reason it's funny to me. i talk about myself all the time.

i don't want to live anymore. i'm a sociopath, and my friends will get hurt around me. my mom will never truly love me. my dad will never come back into my life.

i'm scared to die, but i also wish i hadn't been allowed to live. maybe if my mom hadn't chosen to have me, everyone's life would be better.

i tried to get help for the way i want to hurt myself at the school counselor. they said they'd get back to me. it's been six months. 

they won't get back to me.

post_00045,"1 year exactly 1 year ago today is when my life went to hell

i was okay 1 year ago, not great but okay. now i hate myself so much i can't look in a mirror. i hate myself so much i beg whatever god is out there to kill me. i hate myself so much i have attempted to take my own life over half a dozen times this year

i don't want to be alive. i don't know how i'm still alive

i'm so tired. please let me die",1
post_00046,"i wish i had checked up on a girl i saw at a gas station i recently saw a couple at a gas station, and the interaction between them left me deeply uneasy. the man was in her face, holding her arm, and speaking to her harshly. she kept her eyes fixed on the ground, looking completely defeated. something about it unsettled me, and i couldn't stop worrying about her. i tried to catch her eye, hoping to silently check if she was okay, but she never looked up.

as they left the store, he walked ahead while she followed, still staring at the ground. i wanted to approach her and ask if she was safe, but i hesitated. my kids were with me, she was too far away, and i didn't know how he might react. even after they left, i kept watching them as they went to their car, and i couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. i even told my teenager, who noticed my concern, that i was worried about her.

for days, i thought about them constantly. i found myself looking for their car whenever i passed by the gas station, even though i didn't know why.

today, i came across their picture in the local news. they both died in a car accident. he was driving and apparently veered out of the lane for ""unknown reasons."" i can't help but feel in my gut that it might have been a murder-suicide, but i'll never know for sure. i didn't know them, and it's not my place, but i can't stop thinking about her. i wish i could've done something to help.",1
