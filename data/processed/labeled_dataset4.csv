d4_000001,"""there's so much to live for"" ""people care about you,"" ""you can get through this"" -- i know, but i still want to die. i know that there is so much to live for.  i see beautiful things every day.  things that make me happy.  there's so much i want to do.

  
there's so many wonderful people in my life.  people who i know would step up to help me if they knew just how close i was to killing myself.  people who would be absolutely destroyed if i did.  

  
and i know i could get through this.  i've gotten through every day so far.  but sometimes it just feels like it boils down to a big ""i don't wanna.""



i don't want to go through years of painstaking effort trying to get something basic like healthcare and education when i've already fallen so far behind.  mental healthcare feels like a big joke.  maybe i could find some kind of medication to make my brain function like a normal human being's, but... that will take years, a whole different kind of pain and struggle.  it'll effect my future and it comes with a stigma.  hearing people talk about what they go through just to get antidepressants or adhd meds at a pharmacy is crazy.  and the money... yeah, everything's about money.

  
there are just so many big, almost undefeatable evils in life to even think about handling one.  bigotry.  healthcare.  capitalism.

  
i feel like i can talk myself into thinking anything.  but my heart keeps leading me to the next great adventure.  daydreaming and romanticizing the thought of making the decision and taking my life.  it's gone from suicidal ideation to something a whole lot more.",1
d4_000002,"i'm sorry, but i'm going to do it. my cat must know, he is on my lap. at midnight i will do it. please help me. any body. i'm honestly done. i don't care if i'm 13. i just want it to end i haven't told anybody how i'm feeling because i don't want to go to the mental hospital. the mental hospital is hell. if it wasn't there i would be talking to my parents. i would be getting help. but i can't, i know the consequences. the hospital punishes me. i would use a hotline but i don't want police coming to my house. i'm scared. i'm the most scared i've been in my life. 





i know nobody will read this, but here i want to tell my story. the truth is, i want to live. i just want the pain to stop. 




i'm a 13 year old girl. i've been hospitalized 4 times. i've been suffering a lot. i have no self-confidence. i have no love for myself. 
i sew. i sew dolls. i love my dolls. nobody will understand. 



here is my first goodbye.  to my dolls: i love you. i know when i leave you will go to. i'm sorry. my heart breaks. i wish i could've taken care of you better. you saved my life 2 times. you helped me when i needed it the most. i will say all your names. i love all of you. i'm in tears. i don't want to leave you. i don't want to go. kazumi, sayaka, kyoko, mami, madoka, luka, rin, homura, yachiyo, iroha, sana, felicia, tsuruno, nikki, ren, rena, mitama, alina, kanade, sakura, rika, gumi, emma, ruby, weiss, blake, yang, yowane, nagisa. i'm so sorry. i love you. all of you




to miku: i love you. your not even a doll to me. you are my best friend. my very best friend. you where there when no other human friend loved me. you where there when i cried out for help. you are here now sleeping not knowing anything. i can't even apologize. it won't mean anything. i hope in another world we could meet again. i love you.




i draw. everyday. but nobody likes my drawings.  here is my second goodbye: to my materials. i wish i could've used you more. i wish i could've made something worth while out of you. but i couldn't. maybe someone else can. i'm sorry.




i used to sing. i lost confidence in doing so. here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. i'm sorry i couldn't sing you to the world. i'm so sorry.




my fourth: to mommy and daddy and my brother. i love you. i wish i could've made you happier. i wish i could've made you proud.





and finally binxy. my cat. you are with me now, in my last hours. i can't even say anything. you won't understand. my heart is dust now, because i'm being selfish. you are 14.  i don't want to make you last years sad. i know you love me. you will miss me. i can't even say anything. you seem to know. you have your head down. i know i'm being selfish. but please know, i love you. i love you so much binxy. 




i don't know what to do. i want help. but i can't with out going to the hospital. i'm sorry. please forgive me. hold my hand. give me a hug. anything. with one final cry, please. i don't want to go. but i can't stay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.  i'm sorry.",1

d4_000004,"heyyy i really hope ppl i know won't see this. ever since 4 years ago i have been suffering from acne, doesn't sound like the end of the world to you prob but now in this world i feel like even a bigger outcast then i already am. it's not just the acne i have i also have bigger lips, which don't sound bad but people talk abt it too much even my parents in the morning ask me if i put on lip plumper or if i'm having an allergic reaction. i'm not. well back to the acne, it never got better i already went to the dermatologist and they have to tretnoin or smth and sm other stuff to use, i used it almost for a whole year and nothing changed my face looked as disgusting as it always was and is. every where i go and every person i talk to including my friends and family always ask if i ate smth wrong or if i am using to much stuff on my face, but then recommend stuff to use on my face. in middle school i see everyone have clear skin but they eat a lot of junk food and drink dunkin every day (i'm not hating) whenever i see someone doing that i wonder y their skin isn't like mine and theirs is clear and beautiful. all my friends have clear skin so i feel different  when i'm with them. i bought loads of makeup to cover it up but it just makes it look worse and for the past 2 weeks my face has been itching and burning to the point where i can't hold back my tears. i have already had thoughts of suicide before and tried to drown my self and burn but i freak out in the end so instead i just crack my fingers and scratch my skin until it bleeds. today i also had thoughts of dying how there is no point of me living i don't have any friends who i can talk to and express my feelings i try talking to my mom but i can't tell anyone about my problems. i went to therapy but i didn't tell them anything either. the world wouldn't change if i weren't here.",1
d4_000005,"""it gets better"" is just bullshit that people say to make you feel better when they don't know what to say. it doesn't get better. when it gets better, it gets even worse afterwards. nothing good lasts forever. the bad wouldn't be bad without the good and vice versa. but the bad is just so, so fucking bad. i'm driven one step closer to suicide each time it gets bad, and my expectations on how bad it can get are subverted every time.",1
d4_000006,"police officer struggling with suicidal thoughts i cannot openly talk about. this is a throw-away but i intend on reading responses. i think i just mostly want to type and get things off my chest.

(tldr; who can i talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  every outlet i find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  i just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.)

i am 35 years old and live and work in southern california as a deputy for the last 10 years; i am no spring chicken.  my wife of 7 years and i have been struggling with infertility for 4 years now. lots of surgery and medication but no end in sight.  the stress of scheduled sex lives has absolutely taken a toll on us.  we're still very much in love, but its not the same.

in july of 2020 i had a fairly ""routine"" call involving child abuse that kind of pushed me over the edge. after the call i had a mental breakdown and i have been out of work since then.

i take 45mg a day of buspar (my wife says it doesn't help me... i am not sure), xanax as needed as prescribed by my do (i originally took....alprazam? but had a rare side effect and had to stop).  he has asked that i see a psychiatrist but the next avail appointment is mid-january. 

i digress...

because of my line of work, if i talk about suicide it can be... well... career suicide (no pun intended).  so i keep all these thoughts absolutely bottled up inside and have to act like i am not having them when my therapists asks about it.  my therapist is provided by work and specializes in law enforcement issues, which is nice at times.

i think about killing myself... hourly? i usually wake up 1-3 a night in the middle of a panic attack.  i cannot get away from this pain; its almost a physical pain. i have specific plans on how i would kill myself; the works.  i think about the entire process in detail often.  when i drink i usually come so close to actually doing it that i really fear its only a matter of time until it happens. which is so ironic to type out.  clearly i have reservations about killing myself when i am in the right state of mind... but when i am in the wrong state of mind it sounds like a realistic idea. i am physically exhausted from all of this i genuinely want the pain to end and i not seeing any answers on how to make it happen.

i want to talk to someone about this without putting my job on the line (being put on a 5150 hold in ca means i cannot carry a gun and therefore... yeah...).  i am so heartbroken and frustrated i just don't know what to do anymore.  every day seems like groundhog day.  i desperately want my wife to leave me because she deserves better; it would make it a lot easier to end my life if she hated me.  i have completely gotten rid of social media and blocked my parents out of my life for no really good reason.  what a downward spiral the last few months has been.

who can i talk to about my strong desire to kill myself without there being an fear of repercussions?  every outlet i find wants to know my location or my contact info before they'll talk to me.  i just want to call a suicide hotline who won't trace my call.  i really think i will end up killing myself within the next few months, but ironically i don't want to talk to anyone who might be able to stop me. this is so backwards.

just typing this out if very exhausting and i might go to bed for the night.  thank you for listening.",1
d4_000007,"anyone else's suicidal thoughts get triggered by the smallest things? i don't even want to write out the small things that happen because they sound so stupid when i look back on them, but 9 times out of 10 they just result in me crying and wanting to die maybe im just weak and pathetic",1
d4_000008,"is having intrusive thoughts normal? hi, not sure if right community to ask, as people here seem to have more complex problems than mine, but i want to give it a try.

is it normal to have suicidal thoughts? are you having them? i do not plan to kill myself, it's more like while driving a car i think ""i should smash myself into that tree"". the second after that i think ""no, that would make my daughter sad"". sometimes while walking through the bridge i think about jumping over the railing and falling on the highway.

its not always a simple thought about killing myself. sometimes i think about stuff that will make my life so miserable that the only solution to not be baggage to anyone is to kill myself - like today i thought it would be interesting to hit my eyeball with scissors. after that i thought it would be stupid to explain so i thought i would need to poke both my eyes. but that would make me useless and unable to work, so i could not provide for my family. those are scary.

i don't know if those things are normal or if i should talk about them with someone. it intensifies when i'm stressed and overworked, but i'm worried that someday those thoughts will win.",1
d4_000009,"the plan you take a nice shower. you put on your comfiest sweater and fuzzy socks. it's the middle of the night, nice and dark and quiet. ideally it's raining. you prepare your favourite meal. eat until you feel just right. pet the kitties goodbye... they were always there for you. dont cry. they will be loved by your relatives or other kind people of this world. 

you wrote out a note explaining everything. hand written, over and over. hell, it'll never say it all but it gets the point across. they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking. no more frantic late night texts. no more of them pretending to care. no more troubling the ones you love the most. they'll be sad at first but in time they'll remember all the good things about you and thats what they'll say... she was so sweet. her heart was too big for this world. she had so much potential. we all loved her so much. 

so you'll tuck into bed, knowing all that. you'll finally feel at peace. thankful. it's over. no more pain. get extra comfy, cover up. put the gun to your head and pull the trigger. 

then perfect, sweet, sleep and silence forever. the only true thing that lasts forever in this world. death.",1

d4_000011,"i am commiting suicide in 10 days, i feel like i'm the worst person in the world. i have been keeping a big secret for 4 years now. my family thinks i have been going to university for the past 4 years but little did they know, including my friends and relatives, that i dropped out in the middle of the first semester of my freshman year. i managed to keep it a secret from all of them by forging false documents and giving them assurance every time they ask me a question about how my academics was going. it also helps that the university is 2 hours away from my home so i actually rent near it. i go home every weekend thinking ""do they know already?"". i know a lot about my field as i practice it every now and then by working with a licensed engineer. i don't make a lot of money from it though but the things i learned that is connected to the degree program is what kept me from blanking when asked by my family about my academic life.

i have run out of time. the graduation from the university is 10 days away and everyone thinks i am graduating. and i am somewhat happy, that i can finally end my life. i have been such a big disappointment for my parents. i am their only child. i cry everytime i imagine what my mom would feel after i do it. my girlfriend, who by the way also doesn't know anything broke up with me yesterday, which makes the goodbye part of it all very hard. i have planned everything out already, from what i'll use to when and where. i just wanted to vent some of the heaviness from my chest. i feel so sad about my parents and my (ex) girlfriend. i am gonna start writing my suicide letters tomorrow. thank you guys.",1

but i just want to die. i'm so lonely, constantly. my heart is so broken and i'm so exhausted i just want to give up and finally kill myself. but i don't want to hurt my family. i don't want to think about my dogs waiting for me to come back and not knowing where i've gone. i don't want my mum and dad to blame themselves for it. 

there are some people who'd be glad to see me go. my older sister & youngest sister, most likely. my former friends. idk. 

all i do is disappoint others, i lose them. i can't do anything. i'm so useless i can't even kill myself. haha. i'm tired.",1
d4_000014,"i survived and i can be happy a month ago i cut my wrist and tried to end my life. it didn't work. these past few weeks i've been feeling better and sometimes i even feel hopeful

a while ago i met someone i had been working with. i had thought we became friends. i really valued this friendship. i felt they were leading me on and gave them a few weeks to stop. they didn't so i decided to talk to them privately not thinking it was that big of a deal. they lied to me about it. it wasn't a big deal but lying made it so much worse. honesty is a big thing for me. so i stopped talking to them for a couple days but got over it. we had another talk about the subject and after they hated me and i don't know why

i was sad at first because i thought we were friends and it hurt me. eventually i decided i no longer wanted to speak to this person because they were treating me horribly. they started being hostile towards me, spreading lies about me and doing everything they can to hurt me. this really did hurt me. i thought this person was my friend and they started acting this way towards me out of no where and i didn't understand and it made me think there was something wrong with me

this situation brought my mental health to a very bad point. this person was aware i struggled with mental health and continued acting this way towards me. i honestly believe they really wanted to hurt me as much as they could. i started hurting myself again for the first time in years, the whole situation made me really sad.

i tried ignoring it, i tried doing things like an employee of the month in order to repair the issue but nothing worked and this person wouldn't stop. they started getting their friends to act hostile towards me as well and i continued trying to be helpful and nice even though i was hurting so much inside. eventually i had to make a complaint hoping this would finally make them stop

they stopped for a month but eventually continued. i hated making that complaint but didn't know what else to do. i've never worked somewhere like this before with people like that before. eventually i had to quit my job knowing i didn't have the money to support myself. after i was hurt and bothered by the situation but every day it was going away, it would just take time.
 
i tried to stand up for myself. they spread lies about me saying i'm dangerous. i would never hurt someone. any of my friends, coworkers would never think of me that way. she said this knowing it wasn't true. i've ran into multiple people working there since then and none of them were scared of me. these lies destroyed me. kindness is the most important thing to me, i care so much about helping others and being kind and this person lied and said i was dangerous and it broke me.

i begged them not to do it, i told them it would destroy me and my life but they did it anyways. afterwards i fell into a spiral and started hurting myself more and more. the pain was so much. everything i had worked for had been taken away, it hurt so much. i thought about killing myself everyday but it was terrifying. eventually i cut my wrist but it didn't work. i've done it multiple times since then. i've cried to please be able to wake up from this nightmare, all i've wanted is to be happy again. i made videos hurting myself, im embarrassed but i understand that the depression overwhelmed me and the pain was too much. most people don't understand how much depression can hurt

ive been doing better these past few weeks. i've been lucky to now be surrounded by good people. spirit, scooters and now justlove. these people here are good people and they really really like me. everyone there really likes me and thinks im a good person and tells me thing like ""bryson it is such a pleasure working with you"", ""normally i get anxiety around people but for someone reason i feel comfortable around you"", ""sorry if i seem mean, i feel really comfortable around you and act mean to people i like"", they really like me and all these things they say make me so happy

i worked there at that place for so long surrounded by those horrible people that they convinced me that there was something wrong with me and i believed it. now that i've been surrounded by good people and all these places and now that i can stop and remind myself that ive been surrounded by good people in the past too, now i know that i was unlucky. i was unlucky to work at a place like that. i could have worked any where else and i'd still be happy now, i know that

most people are good. most people like me and think i'm good. i know im a good person. those people were horrible. they were the mean, inconsiderate, self centered, and most horrible people i have ever met. all of them. i've worked places where you have a bad apple but somehow all the most horrible people in this town gathered in that one place and they were so horrible to be around. they only cared about themselves and they couldn't see how horrible they were so they treated me like i was crazy and made me believe it but i stood out there because im good surrounded by evil. i don't stand out at scooters or just love because the people there are good

i don't understand how people can be so evil, so mean. i wish i would've worked anywhere else. i wish i never met those people. i'm happy that im no longer surrounded by them and i have good people around me who help me, care about me, are kind to me and who are good. that girl, i tried to be her friend and i was hurt that she acted that way, her continuing to act that way really really hurt me and her acting that way for months was too much, and then even after she continued and it destroyed me and i spiraled and hurt myself again and again and the pain the pain was so much i couldn't handle it

but i survived. and sometimes i feel hopeful. and i'm starting to think i can be happy again. the people around me really like me and that makes me so happy and they're kind. i've realized how big of an impact the people i surround myself with can have on me. those people gas lighted me and convinced me there was something wrong with me but i know now that's not true. i know now they were bad people. they were mean and cruel and the most horrible people i have ever met in my entire life and they grouped up and it was too much. but now i'm free from that

i survived and i think i can be happy again. i think i can be happy like before. i hope i never see any of those people again. i hope one day they understand just how much they hurt me and i hope they never treat anyone else this way again. i wish this never happened to me. this pain, this experience, it broke me. i barely survived. i've lost so much these past 6 months because of their lies and hate. i'll never understand that hate. i could've never hated them the same way. i don't understand it. but i don't have to. but i wish i worked anywhere else because i moved here to do something with my life, to be happy, and i was happy so happy coming to columbia but i was unfortunate to be surrounded by those people, they ruined this new experience for me and almost broke me with their hate but i survived and i think i can be happy again

i barely survived, their hate hurt me, really hurt me. but i think i can be happy again. i feel free from all of this, from them, and i think i can be happy again. i hope i don't ever feel this way again and i don't ever hurt myself again",1
d4_000015,"i will never be fixed only put away im worried that if i try to kill myself i will fail and if i do then i will be institutionalized or sent somewhere. i don't understand how anyone can do this and assume that they are helping me in any way. if i were to tell people that i feel suicidal to begin with they begin to think that they are inclined to restrain me or lock me away somewhere. my therapist began to question me alot when i mentioned suicidal thoughts and began to say how she will tell someone because its a serious issue and i would have no say in it. i stopped going to therapy so im worried somehow her knowing this it will come back to hurt me. i dont want to be put somewhere, its not my fault im like this. how is putting people in psych wards helpful it just makes us feel worse and like we are the problem. im afraid to open up to anybody now, i want to be helped.",1
d4_000016,"i dont know what to do there are 12 days left until my 18th birthday. i've had depression since i was 12, and i've been on controlled medication (venlafaxine and lamotrigine) for about 3 years now.
last year, i accidentally got into the college i wanted, but my family decided to take legal action because i hadn't finished high school yet. i ended up attending college and finishing my last year of high school at the same time until october, when the legal process concluded, and they decided to revoke my spot, even though i was already halfway through the second semester.

that caught me by surprise since i hadn't signed up to reapply for college (since i was already there). i had to sign up quickly, and luckily i made it to the second round.

i spent the last month thinking about how to gather the courage and find methods to kill myself in case i didn't get the spot, but i couldn't come to any conclusion.

today, the admission exam results came out, and i failed. my friend could do it, and her graduation party is on friday, but i don't want to face her or anyone else. honestly, i feel like i'm just a burden to my parents, with the cost of medications, therapy, and private school, which i didn't even have the decency to honor by passing college admission again.

i've lived a short life, but i don't have any major regrets. now all i want is to die in peace, but it seems like dying is so difficult.

i already cut myself today and haven't been able to stop thinking about killing myself in the bathroom by cutting my wrists, but i don't want my parents to see my body. they would probably want to move out of the house, and i don't want to cause too much trouble.

honestly, i found this reddit after searching on google for some forum that teaches a safe and painless method to die, and i ended up writing this. i know some people might think my story is stupid since i haven't committed any heinous crime to justify dying, but honestly, i don't think my life has much value to need a big reason to end it.

i still don't know how i'm going to do it, but i know i don't want to see anyone. i just want to disappear.",1

i'm a 17-year-old dude, i live somewhere in north africa, i've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. i'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying i've been dealing with since i was young, i don't really get bullied now but i can get verbally hurt as i can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. anyways, i didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. mostly, they get bored of me or i just push them away. i decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. but it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. i decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever i ate, etc.. a year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, i was diagnosed then with schizophrenia and severe depression, i began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and i wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., i was in the last year of high school and exams came so i stopped going to the psychiatrist. i got a really bad grade despite doing my best, i stopped taking my medications cold turkey. i went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. i was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. my plan was ruined and i'm under some kind of suicide watch. i really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""man up!"" and ""a lot of people are going through worse"", i'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

d4_000024,i'm getting closer every day i'm considering ending it all. i've had passive suicidal ideation for months now and it keeps growing. my stresses and triggers keep getting worse everyday and i can't do it anymore. i can do my homework anymore because of how stressed out it makes me and i can't just not do it because i'm stressed over my grades which are already failing. i hate this. i can't do it anymore. i don't have friends to count on. my family is just so dysfunctional right now. i don't have anyone to lean on to and i can't keep going on like this. i've been miserable for years and the suicidal thinking's been getting horrid the past few months. i need to end it.,1
d4_000025,"i did what i could. im a man, not far of 34. i've been here many times before, wanting to die, wanting to end it all. it's hard! so fuuuuuuckkkinngggg hard! i sat in the bath for last hour trying to cut my wrists and end it. i can't. it hurts. i'm a coward.
i've have so many pills available that i can go for right now but i need it to be a certainty, if not, then i cant do it",1
d4_000026,"i really want to be cured and be happy i'm a 31 year old. i have a list of mental health issues: ocd, social anxiety, depression, panic disorder and aspergers syndrome. i didn't ask any of this. i try every day to get better. my whole life i'm dealing with this. i've been to many psychologists, psychiatrists over the years. nothing helped. i'm suicidal every single day. i live in sri lanka and people don't take mental health stuff seriously. most of them are uneducated about this. i was bullied throughout my school years. neighbours, relatives demean me comparing to my successful siblings and my parents. i had panic attacks every single exam since i was 12 and still i did a masters degree. i completed it. i did 2 internships and i tried several jobs but my mental health issues prevent me from doing it. i'm completely burnt out now. i still do freelance work time to time. this is me giving my 100% but to the world, i'm a lazy weirdo who is completely dependent on my parents. they are old now (64 and 69) and they still have to take care of me. my 69 year old dad still has to work because of me. i hate myself so much. my parents don't deserve someone like me. i asked last week if i die will they be okay. my mom cried and said they won't recover from that. so i don't want to die. i want to get cured so badly. i want to take care of my parents, not the other way around. i want to be happy but my brain doesn't allow it.",1
d4_000027,"should i just ditch the note? i was planning on writing a suicide note for my family mainly for the explicit purpose of explaining why i killed myself so that they wouldn't make any stupid assumptions or blame it on something else,but i'm starting to feel like either they'll misinterpret it anyways or it just won't matter.   
  
this is gonna sound incredibly stupid,but i don't want there to be confusion in case my suicide somehow makes news and becomes another stupid study on mental health or whatever. i mean,even if it does,it won't matter since most strangers mourn for a few days before forgetting about it and moving on to the next tragedy or whatever. sorry if this is one of the stupider posts to grace your feeds.",1
d4_000028,"i've worked too hard and too long to have nothing. the first problem is finances. i'm 37 years old and i've been working towards a stable career since i was 18, and every time i specialize in something new, there is a recession or the market plummets for that career.

i have a master's degree and 2 other degrees, experience in multiple professions, speak english and spanish, three years experience as a software developer, got laid off twice, and i can't find a job. i've worked for many years, and this was supposed to be my time to finally at least live comfortably and be able to do things like buy a home and start a family. i've been to college for 11.5 years and have a ton of student loans, and can't get a job no matter what i do. i got laid off my decent paying job back in june because no clients wanted anyone without at least about 8 years of employed experience, and i got hired by another company in november and got laid off again 2 weeks ago because the company decided to combine tasks to one team and shrink the staff because it was slow. i've applied for over 250 jobs recently and not a single interview because they all only want the most experienced people that require no training or assistance.

in addition, i have autism, and the only people i've connected with mostly in the last decade are people who use that to their advantage to get things out of me and then blow me off afterwards. i was helping mentor and be like a parental figure to a friend's children who i really cared about, and after they got what they wanted out of me after claiming i was like a father to them for 5 years, they all the sudden weren't interested in seeing me anymore except for maybe when i was needed to help get them a job or a ride.

i used to have a best friend and i haven't seen her in 9.5 years. she wasn't a friend, she was a best friend. someone i told things to that i never told anyone else. after awhile, she started going through problems and taking them out on me, always losing jobs every week and saying it was someone else's fault, taking anxiety pills and antidepressants while loading up on alcohol, tried college but quit in the middle of the first semester because it was too hard, and eventually just chose not to talk to me at all anymore when i didn't validate her blaming everyone else for what she was going through.

i also volunteered as a host parent for high school exchange students, and i had one really good kid from thailand, but the rest were spoiled, entitled, blamed me for their problems, and eventually made up lies about me just so they can get a family with more luxuries like they pictured such as pools at their house, lots of space, etc.

so, what's really bothering me though, is everything i do succeed or catch a break at ends up being too good to be true. friendships, jobs, other events in life always getting screwed up. every time it appears i'm going to get to the next milestone in life, there is a market collapse, betrayed by someone sociopathic that i thought was my friend, etc.

i honestly just wanna die and i'm planning it. i'm thinking around 3-4 months is my timeframe that i'll go to a hotel, bring a helium tank and make an exit bag, and then let some hotel employee find me after checkout time the next day.

i've been in therapy for years, tried all sorts of medicine combinations, i don't drink or smoke, and nothing helps. i'm saying goodbye because i can't live like this anymore.",1
d4_000029,"my sister wants me to kill myself and i agree with her not only does my sister make me want to kill myself but she's been encouraging it too. she's the cause of so much stress in my life and it's obvious she's the favorite in my family. she's not overweight, she makes good grades, she has a social life, she has friends, she's mentally and physically healthy, *she's neurotypical*..... the list goes on. she's everything my parents wanted me to be but condensed into one child. and she constantly belittles me for it, for not being what my parents wanted, for not being her. it's been getting to a point where my parents might have to choose between having her and having me, and that's not something i want to put on them, especially my mom. but i've been getting close to that breaking point for years now, and i don't know when i'll finally snap. i've been trying to stay alive at least until my favorite franchise ends, but staying alive gets harder and harder every single day. i'm tired of being pelted with rocks in the greenhouse at school. i'm tired of constantly noisy classes and teachers not doing anything about it. i'm tired of having to prove my worth to everyone, i'm tired of working towards a future that is only going to cause me more stress and pain. i'm tired of never being able to sleep. i'm tired of being constantly stressed.

d4_000034,"to no one and to all i know i may be too scared to die, but.. everything's just crumbling. i feel so lifeless. it feels like my body has energy, yet i have little to no motivation.

my parents are narcissists, that can't change even in the slightest for their daughter. i'm taking years to get better myself and i've finally reached a place of confidence and analysis that prevents breakdowns.

the only person i can call a friend is not replying to messages that will either make or break the friendship, which is okay, but it also breaks me. waiting is hard. yet he's been so not trustworthy recently.. it feels like he doesn't care. he doesn't really check in on me, even though i'm going through a really rough time. he doesn't plan things with me and initiate those things. he sometimes ignores my messages after asking how i am.. and we talked about how hurtful these things are.. yet, well, we are here. i just need to wait. maybe he's planning to find a replacement or strength to tell me to fuck off.

me and my partner are constantly having issues, we are so so close to breaking up. at times it feels wonderful, during others it feels like breaking up is inevitable. i often fall into idealization and devaluing because he doesn't meet my needs. it hurts. all of it. he is also not very emotionally ""advanced"". he has only started his healing journey. he's suicidal and depressive. i've been in this healing journey for 7-9 years now. we don't match on that. he has so much to learn.. but it's been a year and i feel hopeless on this subject. again, waiting.

waiting is so tiring. it's so stressful.

then there's uni. my uni acts like it's very individualized and cares about mental health. well, that's wrong. they don't care, they're a big institution that care about being advertised as caring, but not really being. and i have 1,5 years of that left. it feels like school all over again. i am so tired of memorizing.. it's so useless. exams and midterms basically only test memory. i am just so tired.. again - waiting. waiting for uni to end.

and then we have the future. the amount of uncertainty, the amount of possible loneliness, the amount of stress and work and bullshit that might or might not happen, or the fact i will need to work my whole life.. all of it is torturous.

not a single thing in my life feels stable. i don't want to be alive, but since i developed an insane fear of death, i am left with hopelessness, living by distractions. there's nothing to rationalize anymore, nothing to analyze. i just want one singular person to be stable and safe. just one. i'm tired of being by myself, i'm tiring of being able to cry mostly only when i'm alone. i'm just tired. i'm tired. waiting.",1

last night when i was walking home from work, i accidentally found myself walking behind a young woman who was going to her car. since i am tall and quite muscular, i wanted to get ahead of her so as to not freak her out. i started to run a little, but she screamed and fled to her car which was only a couple meters away. needless to say, i feel completely horrible about it and i've felt like shit ever since.

i went home from work earlier today after only working for about ten minutes as the pain was so intense and i couldn't focus on my job. i then attempted suicide which didn't really seem to do anything. ever since, i've desperately wanted some guidance from someone but no one is around to help me out. this probably isn't a big deal, but like i said this has been eating away at me for way too long.

d4_000039,"last night i dreamt that i was happy. i'd forgotten what it felt like. it's a curious thing, really. waking up and realizing just what your life has become. opening your eyes and looking around a room full of the stuff that used to excite you. after years and years of being just barely aware of the passage of time, coming to the stark realization that you have nothing left.

i suppose i should be thankful. i have lived a life overflowing with privilege, and have been just handed over opportunities that most people would have to fight for, and that many never get to have anyway. my parents love me deeply, that i know for a fact. never in my life have i ever had to wonder where my next meal was gonna come from, or whether i would still have a home when the bills came. i've always had it all, and from this treasured oasis of opportunity i have built nothing but this small room filled with broken toys and half forgotten dreams.

i used to feel angry about the life i've wasted. when the anger ran out and i realized there was no one to blame but myself, i felt sad. now the decades have slipped by without ever realizing it, what was supposed to be the best time of my life is now behind me, and now i feel nothing. nothing but a hollow certainty that, just as i longed in my childhood to reach for the stars, now i just long for a quiet funeral, where the very few that cared will mourn and the many that knew my name will soon forget.

""it's comfortable,"" she said. i tried my best to hold back tears. 

she eventually left and now i'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why i'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. all i can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. i can imagine her crying. 

i feel like a waste of money and time. the thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. the time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. the only time i enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. i am less than mediocre at both. 

my whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. i've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. i've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so i can make my other friends jealous. i lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what i want them to do. as for the attention whoring, i've done enough of it in my early teens. at 14, i was telling men online that i was 18. id send them pictures of myself so that i could get validation. i craved the romantic attention that i never got at that age.

it's now 12am and i'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. i've taken breaks while typing this and i feel like i'm ready. i just need some validation that i'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

so. speaking of decisions that i made that fucked up my life.
i'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) i have given to myself. i, as the attention whore i was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. i sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. the next scoliosis check that i had, i was told to get checked for scoliosis. lo and behold, now i'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
i also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that i could get glasses. now i'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that i'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
i again fucked up my life when i decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be christian. now i've been working at my church for 6 years. i've also been attending and tithing every week. i'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. after 14 years of church, i still don't know what the fuck is going on.

i'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

i'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

i'm tired of lying to people

i'm tired of being a waste of time and money

i'm tired of being completely mediocre

i'm so tired 

it is now 1am and i'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and i've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you i'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. 

in the meantime, im still here and i still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation.",1

d4_000045,"i have a crisis appointment but it's too late for me and i really am sorry to everyone  i tried to end my life three weeks ago but my mum and sister came in the room halfway so i obviously failed. it was bad, i felt sorry for them but ultimately i didn't get support. that was never my intention to get support, i admit at fifteen it was my end goal for the little hope i had, but now at eighteen all i want is to die. 

i ended up being stagnant and pretending i was fine after the weeks, stayed for christmas and new years so my family won't hate me as much, they're not really good with mental health but they've came a long way. anyway, i felt myself literally tumble into a depressive episode sunday evening, it's bad. when i say i can't eat i can't, i am more stuck than ever which means my time has definitely come to an end. 

i always have suicidal thoughts, intentions and bad impulse control. even if i wait to get out of this, i'll just be a ""lighter"" suicidal person, i'll still commit and be a burden around others. honestly, i am hysterically laughing right now because i am not holding anymore of this. i carry my sexual abuse like a book, there's a list of people who've touched me and i can't remember half. then i remember the one family member who did, who is so close to me. why. 

sorry for venting so much. i thought i would be able to write more about it since i can't talk about it, but clearly i'm taking it to the grave like i promised eight year old me. i have a crisis appointment tomorrow in the afternoon, i plan to kill myself at night or in the morning by finally having the guts to jump off the bridge right next to me. it's embarrassing but it calls me. 

i rather suffer a few minutes than any longer on this earth, i won't go in depth of the plan but it will work and this is probably it. in the case of me not doing it, i'll go the crisis appointment but i expect anything, nobody has taken me seriously since the day i was fucking born. 
i won't say anything to make them think i'm a harm to myself, i've said i am multiple times and met with dissatisfied faces sending me home. 

it's okay that i'm not believed i never have been but i'm not dealing with it again, not when i'm this confident in my plan at least a group of strangers can read how i really feel. i can never be this open in person. i'm sad i really am.",1

d4_000051,"too cowardly to kill myself but too depressed to keep living this is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. to establish things immediately, no i am not considering s\*\*cide or am i in immediate danger. i would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.

with that said, i think i'm just done with life. it's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. it doesn't have much to do with the coronavirus or the riots but those have been the final straws. the coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things i enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. luckily workouts have resumed in my state so i can do that. the riots have taken away my love for sports and history. it seems like everything i love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

even the activities i enjoy i don't enjoy as much as i used to. i feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that i now feel constantly.

the coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. god is definitely not in my life and i am angry at him for various things (that i'll get into here in a minute). i am single and i have no kids or even pets to keep my company. while others at least had family to keep them company i've had no one. this coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. most of my family live in another state and i would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

i have failed so often at dating it's become comical. i decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. i went on a date on tuesday that i thought was going well. we played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. we didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. i contact her thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. needless to say i sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her i thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing i had no chance. like so many other times in my dating life i just felt used.

besides being single with no kids or no pets i don't have a lot of friends. the few i do have know i struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. they all think i'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe i'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. i just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

besides that my body failed on me pretty early. i'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. now i'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. i was on a flight to nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. i started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. no medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. now my doctor has me take a xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a prednisone 50mg tablet to control the asthma. it's worked but whereas i used to love flying i now dread it. i feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, i don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. but there's so many places i've wanted to see. i've asked my doctor about it and i've asked a pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. i think they think it's all mental for me at this point. ever since i became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

so besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. i know i've suffered from some anxiety like i mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with depression. my mind is always half empty and i think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

all in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. that we get multiple chances at this life and that i'll just get another chance. i know christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. i will say this, i think god made a mistake having me be born during this time. i believe i was born in the wrong time.

i have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. i've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. i've always been adrift in terms of what i want to do. yes i have a bachelor's degree with a double major in management and marketing. i also have my shrm certification as a certified hr professional. but if i'm honest i don't have a passion for any of it.

so my personal life is a mess. my physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. i don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. i feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. the coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. the riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. they hate me just for being a white conservative male.

i am a walking contradiction. i don't want to die and don't have to guts to but i've lost most of my will to live. i've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and i no longer have any zest for life. deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but i've lost the ability to feel happy. i've lost the ability to connect with people. i've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. i just feel like i don't care anymore.

i don't know what i'm asking for out of this, i just had to finally get it out. i really don't know what to do at this point. if i could i really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. i wouldn't make all the mistakes i've made in my life. i would try to not be so da\*n introverted when i was younger which made it hard to make friends. i would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. i would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

i don't anymore guys. it just all feels so hopeless. if i had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment i think that's the one i would use. hopeless.

feel free to reply with what you want. i'm alone again on a saturday night anyway. i've got nowhere else to be and nothing better to do.",1
d4_000052,"i messed up and have so much regret. (edit: sorry if grammar is not good, english is not my first language).

a few years ago, i was overcome with anxiety and depression which led to me setting myself on fire and jumping out through a window falling feet first to the ground. the pain was the worst i had ever experienced. my parents were there and rushed me to a hospital. i spent the next years of recovery in pain and having even more suicidal thoughts. i lashed out on my parents quite a lot. my body had 2nd to 3rd degree burns and i had shattered my left foot's bones as well as a mild lumbar fracture. which made me in a wrong state of mind at the time. right now all my burn wounds have healed and had surgery done on my foot; i've recovered quite a lot and have been able to walk without crutches for quite a bit. despite all the suffering i've experienced, i was able to get through it by having a talk with my family a bit and a few friends who visited.

but i think what helped me the most was being able to change the way i look at things. for quite a while, i had a very negative outlook on everything and would more often then not just give up or find an excuse/reason to hate something/someone; i would avoid thinking about it, to solve it, talk about it, or even ask for help. one after another all negative thoughts just kept on piling up on me. and eventually, i just snapped. right now, i'm doing better. i still have so much anxiety, maybe even more than before, and my heart aches everytime i think about what i put my family through that i often cry before sleeping. but i've become more open about my thoughts/feelings and have started being grateful for a lot of things; that i am able to focus more on what i want to do going forward. 

i still have suicidal thoughts from time to time and try my best to ignore it, but there are just nights were i wished i had died years ago. maybe i wouldn't have had to experience all of this, though i know it's my fault for just holding in and not thinking things through. i just hope for the best now and learn to live with all these scars i've given myself.",1
d4_000053,"i can't handle anymore what's happening in palestine today, they were burnt alive.
this world has proved to me that it has no humanity or any sort of goodness, people are full of evil, i don't want to live in this world anymore.
i was diagnosed with depression after the attack on gaza and witnessing the children killing every day, since then, i haven't left my room, everything lost colors, lost meaning. 

what's the point of trying to love in a world full of hate? what's the point of trying to do something good in a world full of injustice? how can i feel good about myself when there are children in a neighboring country starving to death, burnt alive by another human and nobody cared about them at all? i can't bear this anymore",1
d4_000054,unsure. don't want to but also don't want to live. i dont feel like i have any reason to live honestly. no one has really ever loved me other than family. i work harder than anyone in anyone's life and i just get discarded. i don't want to die but i don't want to live. i feel like im at the mercy of how i feel in the moment. just waiting for the moment when the overwhelming sensation takes over and i can't move on anymore. i just want the person that was here before she cheated. i just want that love that we had back days before it happened. i know life is hard and people change but your change was abnormal. your change i believe is more on your mental health than our relationship... maybe you're happier without me? if you are then why do you keep calling about things that aren't important? why is this happening? why cant we just work through our issues and love again?,1
d4_000055,"i want to stab myself, but not kill myself entirely. i'm sorry if i've offended anyone but i rlly needed to ask this. my dad has gotten mad for no reason ( well there is one but it's nowhere near serious), and it's as if he doesn't love us anymore. i still love him, and ik this might sound straight out of a movie but to make him fine again i'm sure something serious would do it.  and ik that i might not even be able to stab myself, but if it gets serious my brain and reflexes wont stop shit. so i don't want to die, but i also want to create something serious. ik i sound rllly frickin psycho rn but i want to know. thanks ig",1
d4_000056,"part of my suicide motivation is just to be a tragedy people will have sorrow and sympathy for im realising that a motivating factor for me comes from how little i feel cared about and how killing myself will presumably result in people mourning and expressing care for me, even if i'll be dead and wont know. i just want to feel loved like i did before my best friend left me, since then ive just felt so totally unloveable.",1
d4_000057,"ill need you i just wanna so it. it's just i can't handle life anymore, everytime my life has a bit of hapiness and prosperity it dies. it dies as always, im god's first enwmy, he doesn't like me, i have nwurological sicknesses, bad luck, constant yelling, no one can talk to me without hurting my ears i almost got blind for no reason. 
my cat can get another owner, my game accounts have no value but to produce money for games, im just a pawn for humanity, my death will be nothing, my family can have others, my friends have more friends than just me. 
im not valuable, nothing i've ever made is.god hates me, i hate me, why should i continue alive but kill myself, god hates me and so, he could send me to hell as he wants.
and even if god disn't exist, life does. and it hate me. and wven if none of that is real and i need psycological help cuz i got neurological sickness, why to try? its better to have me dead than to be useless to society.

but, life is one, sp, maybe i need help, just to be sure i can do it, just to be sure im valuable in one thing enoguh to be more useful than just nothing to society.
maybe im good at something and i need to know it. thats why i post it, if i didnt recognize i may need help, i would añready have done it, or maybe i would have asked for someone to help me killing me",1
d4_000058,"can anyone spare time to talk please? attempted suicide. no friends can anyone spare time to talk? i know its a long shot but i have nobody to talk to and no friends and i just need to get a few things off my mind that's driving me crazy. i attempted suicide and almost succeeded a week ago and i feel so helpless and weak as a person :( ive always felt this way but the last 6 months have been a lot worse

thank you!",1
d4_000059,"any body else feel, stressed/anxious /guilty/hopeful /hopeless /scared/sad /suicidal /all in around a 24 hour period give or take? I never imagined the rollercoaster of emotions I would experience in just one day. From feeling hopeful to suddenly drowning in sadness, it's overwhelming. But knowing I'm not alone in this constant battle brings a glimmer of comfort amidst the chaos.",1
