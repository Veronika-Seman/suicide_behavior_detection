I'll thank QueenOfIssues420 and No-Alarm9339 who replied to the earlier post.\n\nSo what happened: It was Christmas last year. Almost entire world was celebrating Christmas and preparing to welcome 2025. I wasn't. I'm 17 (M), I lost my elder sister 21 (F) to cancer on 29 December, 2024. \n\n(Just to make it clear about possible misunderstandings, there's no incest. She was an elder I used to look up to)\n\n* I didn't attend her funeral, I simply couldn't. She was very close to me, even closer than my parents, (my relations with my parents were strained can't deny that, she was more of a bridge that prevented conflicts). I would like to say this, she helped me understand women emotions better, being a adolescent male it was hell hard to understand opposite gender. (Maybe even prevented me going down the misogynist path). \n* She used to comfort not to feel sad about her death. Deep down I accepted it, I felt that I could accept the tragedy, it was my misunderstanding that I used to believe myself a strong man. \n* Now when she's gone, I can do nothing but cling on to her memories. Every moment I chose the route of escapism. I binge-watched animes, movies, story games, songs just to get myself away from the reality. But that didn't help. During the initial days, even if I closed my eyes I still went back to the golden past in my childhood days. It affected my sleep, yes. Escapism path was a failure it seems, but I still choose this path, I don't know why.\n* Academics? I had a lot of ambitions, but well it doesn't matter anymore it seems. \n* On a hopeful note, the medications seem to work now. I am hopeful that it will give some relief it seems, but can't gurantee it. Anyone else who faced similar situation, what was your steps to overcome this? And does escapism work? \n* It would have been probably easy if my grandma or even mom passed away, at least I could argue with myself that they were aged,( it seems a coping mechanism argument too)",

Weirdly enough I was going wedding dress shopping for my future SIL and the entire time I kept getting them, it such a strange trigger. Do any of you guys get the same feeling and how do you deal with them?

Now as years have passed and after what my daughters have told me. I realize there was and still seems to be phycological abuse in her relationship today. Sounds like it's on pretty even grounds between the two. What's bothering me is when I find out my ex wife has been depressed, short tempered, rage 😡 texting and raging 😤 over small things. Her rage 😡 has been mostly directed at her boyfriend and my daughters to an extent. Is it right of me to mind my own business and stay clear? That's what I have been doing, but sometimes I think 🤔 or get the impression my girls occasionally wished I'd intervene. I feel pretty confused sometimes, that woman is still my friend, just not my wife. She doesn't confide in me, but she sure has said some pretty rude ass things in front of me about him. That actually shocked the shit 💩 out of me.

Then I was thinking 🤔 maybe she wouldn't out of pride. My ex wife is a tough nut 🌰 to crack. I have a lot of opinions on her mental health state and at one point I was thinking 🤔 she needed psychiatric support. She fell into a serious mental health crisis that was challenging for all family members that dealt with her at that time. \nI love ❤️ my ex wife as a friend and just want her to be happy 😃 even if it means being with someone who will make her happy. It just doesn't seem like her current partner is doing a very good job in that department.

Sometimes, I also think I might have co-morbity with high functioning autism and ADHD. I consider myself to be highly self aware. But I might really have covert narcissism.\n\nI have a fragile ego, and I am insecure about a lot of things. My symptoms also present themselves in a weird way because they're influenced by my personal interests. I am interested in psychology, spirituality, philosophy, and stuffs like enlightenment. I am a Catholic, and there was a time when I don't go to church and my reason was because I am bored of the preaching of the priests because it's repetitive. I also find it hard to read inspirational books because I think I won't find anything new in those books. I have a huge ego, but I also experience extreme anxiety. However, I do not think I am incapable of empathy.\n\nJust some additional info about me, I did experienced traumatic things growing up. I was also bullied when I was in elementary, & I often fantasized about getting back at my bullies but it never happened. But there were also times where I have sudden extreme feelings of compassion for my bullies and think that they might be going through something at home. I also consider myself to be a highly sensitive person.\n\nGrowing up, I had been told I'm weird or odd. And I also personally always felt like I am different. So at the age of 14, I started searching for who I am and trying to understand myself. Unfortunately, at 16, I begin to experience anhedonia. I am only starting to recover from anhedonia recently and I really hope and pray that I will continue to recover from it because it sucks not even being able to feel pain and sadness. The only emotions I was capable of feeling with anhedonia were anger, shame, guilt, and fear, and some shallow happiness.\n\nI do think that I am bad at showing empathy. But I've always been able to understand how others feel both cognitively and emotionally. It's also a characteristic that made me feel something weird as a child. To me, it felt like I can read other people's minds and see from their perspective. That's why I got into disagreements with my playmates because I told them I can read their minds and understand their perceptions and how they experienced their experiences. However, when I became a teenager, I learned that it is insensitive to say you understand someone. So I rewired my brain. However, I did not stop from trying to empathize with other people.\n\nNot being able to know other people's point of view and how they see me actually makes me feel existentially alone, even when I was a child. I had question if everyone was really real, and my sense of empathy is my source of affirmation that other people are in fact existing as well. So I think I am a covert narcissist but the idea that I cannot empathize just do not make sense to me. So if there's a mental health professional here who might help, I need some clarifications.

I would ask how their day was, and just by the response, I would know what to expect the next few days.

They would always beat me up because I was short, weak and couldn't do anything (I later had a growth spurt in 12th grade, now I'm just under 6ft and nobody has tried) regardless.

Well, at the moment I \"can\". The mother of my child has done everything in her power to hurt me using my daughter, and believe me, it's worked. It's hurt me more than anything I've ever experienced. I've done nothing wrong there. I've always wanted to be there for my girl and raise her.

I often fantasize of me just dying in my sleep due to epilepsy. \n\n I don't know how things are going to get better, but I truly hope they do. I just hope I get to say goodbye before I do. ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone I tried to make this as short as possible but I feel the full story is best to understand my self-pity/loathing.\n\nSo I’ve had low self-esteem and abandonment issues for most of my life. Recently I’ve really been struggling with it as my half sister blocked me, and with how i’ve been treated by my half brother. It’s been a month since this situation but It’s still affecting me.\n\nSo theres two reasons to my sister blocking me. Firstly, she said I was using her to get to my bf. I lived on college campus and she would come pick me up to hangout, but because her house was closer to my bf’s, he would come pick me up from there. I thought this was an agreed plan as I got to hang out with both of them, and she was completely fine with me leaving after. \n\nThe next reason- Christmas rolls around and I spent time with my relatives since I hadn’t seen them in a while. As my sister has her own place, I planned to visit afterwards, especially since I already made visiting her first a priority for so long. Well…I completely forgot about her birthday. I knew her birthday fell on Christmas, but apparently I forgot on the exact day. I had to leave the next morning and there was no text nor call of happy birthday, no gift, nothing. Completely my fault. I felt terrible, and she decided to cut ties with me. We have a big age gap so I we only started our relationship a year ago. Again, half sisters and she’s much older as I’m 18 and she’s 29. Summer of 2024 we hung out all the time, and were practically full sisters. When she said she was blocking me, my brain just flipped on fight-or-flight. Abandonment issues. I apologized and tried to explain, but she was hurt and I couldn’t handle it. I just let her block me.\n\nOnto my half brother, 35, one of the relatives I visited on Christmas since he lives with my dad. I hadn’t seen him in a while but we’ve had quite a few arguments, and just times where he would blatantly insult me. Usually I would be used to it since I knew he was depressed, but I was already going through a hard time with older sis blocking me. When he said “No wonder she blocked you” during an argument I just went and bawled in my room.\n\nNow I’m living with my bf and recently when he says he loves me, I know he does, but my mind just immediately responds with “No you don’t”. I know this is illogical, but my brain can’t help but believe my emotions. I don’t feel like he loves me even though he’s incredibly sweet and loving. It wasn’t like this before. I’ve just been feeling utter hatred for myself, I feel I’ll always end up doing damage. Before this situation, I already had a lot of emotional neglect growing up as a kid and past relationship issues. I feel I’m undeserving of love, and I don’t know who to go to. I don’t know what to do.",

I am in therapy and I intellectually know what I'm doing, but man this is just a vicious cycle for me that I hope to one day break. \n\nThe pattern begins with a task that takes a lot of effort and and time to complete with a deadline: think research paper for school, big presentation at work, a proposal for work.  \n\nJust the thought of the task starts to trigger a little anxiety.  I start the task by opening the document, writing a little or prepping a little. But, its not easy or fun and the deadline is in the future. I don't get very far and go on to do something else - answering e-mails, doing an easy task at work, cleaning my house.  \n\nI tell myself I'll work on it at X point in time.  Maybe over the weekend, or on a slower day at work, or when I have some additional information. When that comes I generally repeat a similar pattern.  Now I delay beforehand by doing something like: cleaning, organizing my inbox, scheduling doctors appointments, applying to other jobs (smh), etc. Finally I get to \"the task\" and start on it it doesn't feel good and I've wasted most of my available time so I don't get much done. \n\nRepeat until the deadline is too close. Now I'm feeling intense anxiety and shame. When asked about it it triggers more anxiety/shame: I say \"yeah, I'm working on it\", or \"its on my list of things to do\", or \"I'm planning on working on it this weekend\" etc. I do not admit that I'm struggling. \n\nNow thought of the task triggers a lot of anxiety/shame. I'm thinking I should have started sooner, I should have spoken up about struggling with it, I don't have enough time to do a good job on this, I can't do this, they should just hire somebody better than me to do this, etc. I generally spend a few days with the shame and thoughts until I'm right up against the deadline. These days are high anxiety, sometimes its hard to eat, I'm on edge and feeling really bad about myself.\n\nNow I have no choice, but to do the thing.  I do it.  It sucks, I hate it.  Each time I uncover something that I could have addressed better with more time, I feel stabs of shame. I absolutely miserable as I do the task.\n\nBut then, I finally complete the task.  I have done it well.  Maybe not as perfect as if I hadn't gone through this process, but still pretty good. I turn it in or present it at work.  It goes great.  I did a good job, receive positive feedback, etc. I now I feel HUGE relief. I also feel proud. I did it, I pulled through, I'm great at my job, people like me, none of my fears came true. \n\nI'm now hit with a wave of exhaustion.

Like giving up seems like the only option, but you don't want to be the person who ended their life because you care too much about the people who would be most affected by your loss, and then you feel guilty for even thinking that way? Personally, I'm not a suicidal person. I've never self-harmed or experienced any major trauma in fact, I've had a pretty good life overall. And yet, I still feel like life can become overwhelming at times. I often feel completely different from everyone else, like I'm on a completely different wavelength. It's hard to explain, but when I think too deeply about it, I start to realize how selfish such an act would be not just to myself, but to the people who love and care for me as much as I care for them. I don’t know if I’m making sense right now since I’m pretty sleep deprived lol but what I really want is an escape from everything, but I would never seriously consider suicide. It's sad some of us feel the way we do i hope whoever reads this and feels like their world is crushing down on them just know there are people who love n care for you as I do too. \n\n:) ",

    "selftext": "I've asked close family to help me better understand where I'm going wrong with my relationships with others. They all say there's nothing other than me being a bit shy, but the way individuals act around me tells me different. I'm hoping to gain better understanding here. Being as open as possible, I believe I am a fairly kind individual. However I struggle to create/ maintain friendships. I am very shy and do hold back (often overthinking about what the right thing to say is as the moment passes). \n\nWith that said I am able to maintain conversation with my coworkers where we laugh and have back and forth, but their body language seems uncomfortable and they seem ready for the conversation to end. Outside of work the friends I have had have all told me at separate times that they are really wanting to find a best friend. This sentence was hurtful as it came accross to me as I simply wasn't good enough to fit that. I had two different individuals invite me to two separate events and when I got there they seemed embarrassed I had shown up as they were there with another friend and avoided me throughout the time I was there. \n\nI understand that potentially I am choosing poor friendships but with the high amount of experiences I have had, I can't help but wonder if it's me. Any advice or helpful ideas would be greatly appreciated. I have gone to therapy in the past and they seemed to acknowledge where I fell short but it was never communicated clearly to me what the problem was. TIA",

And before anyone says try journaling I'm on the autism spectrum and can't really spell properly. So it would just make things worse for me. I'm not entirely too sure what to do anymore.

I’m not against the diagnosis, but my dad is. Despite hearing my psychiatrist confirm it twice, he insists I’m “normal” and that this will pass, often calling me odd and often yelling at me saying how lucky I am and the normal parent stuff whenever I bring it up.\n\nWhile all of this is confusing to me, some of my traits haven’t changed, even after two months on medication, which makes sense for bipolar—but some don’t fit at all. I’ve been researching and noticed everything aligns with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), which I started suspecting recently.\n\nMy dilemma is if I should just tell my therapist or if I should also tell my dad, mentioning NPD might make things worse.

All my friends from highschool have moved far into universities so its been hard to keep up with them because theyre doing their own thing and making friends at CC is really hard. Even writing this message, its hard for me to form my thoughts into sentences. Its like I completely lost touch with myself and the person I am. I workout almost everyday and try to keep myself busy with 2 jobs, but I still don't know where my life is going and I feel rushed but at the same time I just exist. This is semi-off topic but one thing that has been on my mind for the past 5 years is my height. Im 5'6 and i didn't realize how much i think about it, everyday i wakeup and look in the mirror and dont want to exist. Whenever I go outside 90% of the people around me are taller and i've normalized that. It really demotivates me and has me question, why even try in my life (in any aspect) if im always gonna be inferior? I feel like at the end of the day if you're short in life theres no point in trying for anything. Social media has been a big part in it too but i've also had girls be really interested in me but when they find out my height they slowly distance themselves or call me out on it. This isn't just about girls though its how people view me as a person, and i can just tell people dont respect me as much because of my stature. My only motivation in my life is to make enough money so i can fly to turkey and afford height surgery. Deep down I know that I should be more oriented on family and trying to better myself in ways I can change, but i continue to live this way. I dont want to kill myself and i never would but i always wish to wakeup and be someone else. I feel like i've been so overwhelmed and drained by all of this over the years and i cant really process emotions or time. i dont need a pity or validation. I just dont know anymore.. sorry its been really hard to gather my thoughts too. everything is just a blur now. (i dont want to hurt myself i just dont wanna be here anymore) - flair",

I am writing this because I genuinely do not think i can go a second longer without getting this off my chest. \n\nA few months ago, I started getting very bad intrusive thoughts. Like, racist and evil thoughts that I do not support. These thoughts have been killing me because I have never had them until about October. They started when I saw a celebrity I thought was cute with a girl of another race than me. To be clear, I have always been very supportive of interracial relationships and watched shows that have many different race relationship so this has never been an issue for me. It wasn’t until I had this disgusting thought of “so he doesn’t want a girl of his own race? (my race)” and I immediately freaked out and was repulsed. But i’ve done everything to try and stop this, but it’s gotten worse. Anytime I see someone of a different race my mind immediately rushes to all of these racist things. I cant even enjoy shows I used to watch with different race relationship couples because I get all of these intrusive thoughts. basically that being white is superior and all white men should date white girls. i cry every single night about this. I don’t understand what is going on with me. i now worry if i really like a guy I will find out one of his exes is a different race and I will start going down this spiral of intrusive thoughts. what the hell is going on with me? I feel so disgusted and even admitting this is terrifying. i feel all this gross white supremacy intrusive thoughts like “how can he not want a white girl or end up with a white girl”\n\nthese thoughts have literally made me think about offing myself. the worst part is i can’t talk to anyone about this because my family is hardcore conservative and will probably encourage this thinking and i’m so embarrassed to bring it up to my therapist. i want to go back to normal when I was happy and supported all relationships and didn’t think horrible things about people of color whenever I saw them. what if these thoughts never go away? they’ve become so present that they feel real, even though I despise them. \n\nso, if anyone’s dealt with horrible intrusive thoughts, specifically racist ones, how do i get rid of them? i find myself obsessing over race and constantly looking up stuff about race on the internet. \n\nthank you.

I was really frustrated, that was too short of notice. They rescheduled me for one month later, and I asked to be put on the cancellation list. Today, I got a call saying there was a last-minute opening, so I immediately booked it. But then the receptionist told me, \"You missed your last appointment, so if you can't make it in the future, make sure to call and cancel.\" Uh, excuse me? It was not on my end. \n\n\nThe psychiatrist I saw is an older gentleman who’s returned from retirement and seemed really experienced, so I felt pretty comfortable. He might have some hearing decrease due to his age, so I need to raise my voice. But when we started talking, he suddenly got serious and told me that he thought I might be bipolar type 2, which completely threw me off. I had spoken to a previous psychiatrist who told me it wasn’t bipolar, so I was in shock. I tried explaining more, he took it as me being over talkative and being irritated, and then his attitude changed. He started acting like I was arguing with him and that I thought I knew more than he did. He even gave me a website to learn, saying I wasn’t very educated on the topic. Then, he became really impatient and stood up to escort me out, telling me to come back in two weeks.\n\n\nAt that moment, I didn’t fully process everything, but when I tried to schedule my next appointment, I asked if I could stay with the same doctor. The receptionist said there was no availability in the next two weeks, so I asked about the third week. The response was completely bizarre. She quickly called over the manager, as if she thought I couldn’t communicate, and the manager informed me that the doctor won’t be there after that. The doctor never mentioned this at all during my appointment; he had said we’d meet again in two weeks. So, I was caught off guard. I ended up having to choose a different doctor.\nWhen I got home and talked it over with a friend, I started feeling like I was being discriminated against. The receptionist’s over-the-top reaction was just so weird. I’m planning to call and file a complaint next week because this whole experience was terrible.\nAnyone else had something similar happen?

I like to journal things as if I’m writing a post lol\n\nI’d love to hear about similar experiences to my own or if anyone knows of any conditions that could fit my description or anything really.\n\nI’m 21. Since around 17, my mental health declined a lot. I feel completely numb, unable to express emotions and like I can never relax or feel “at peace”. I haven’t cried in years except for once after a pretty traumatic event. I’m indifferent about most things and rarely get fazed. It’s just bizarre to me because I’m not so sure that this is depression.\n\nI’ve read about the varying mental health struggles with others and more often than not, these people usually describe breakdowns. From what I could tell, they seemed to be very emotional experiences for them. This might sound ignorant or undermining or something else but I really wish I felt so strongly about anything. \n\nI always wish I was somebody else. There’s been times where I’ve tried to be louder, more expressive with my emotions but it feels fake as if I shouldn’t be doing that because it’s not who I really am inside. \n\nIt’s probably worth mentioning that my whole life I’ve been lonely. I don’t know if it’s bad luck or I’m just a bad person but everyone I’ve called a friend has ultimately done something to hurt me. Some significant moments for me through time:\n\n- Being deliberately left out. \n- Group I thought I was friends with added me to their group chat to show them talking behind my back and then removed me from it.\n- One friend in a group hated me and put the rest of the group in a position of “it’s either me or him” and they chose him.\n- Went through the process of renting a place with someone I was close with for uni. They suddenly pulled out not long after sending their deposit money, refusing to talk about it and leaving me to find someone to replace them with. A month or so later, they’re renting a place with some other people. \n\nRight now I have one friend who I’m kinda close with. There’s 3 other people who I guess are “friends” which haven’t opened/responded to my messages for weeks even months. I’ve always felt like the absolute last resort for people like if you’ve chosen me, I think “you must be desperate for company”. People often say something along the lines of “eventually, it must be something to do with the individual” but I genuinely believe I’m a good and nice person. I’m definitely not the most fun guy out there but I always try to make sure people are comfortable with me. Most of all, I’m not a mean, nasty or unpleasant person it’s just not in my nature.\n\nAnyway, I think loneliness influenced my mental state big time. Constantly being on your own and rarely ever talking to anybody really stripped me of all motivation and has made me feel so empty. \n\nI do wonder where I would be if I wasn’t so lonely.

I don’t even know why I feel sad; there’s no specific reason. I just wish I knew why.\n\n\nEverything around me feels empty—my work, my personal life, my parents, everyone in my inner circle, and even people in my outer circle. My parents are forcing me to get married and are showing me random people. I have a boyfriend, and if I compare him to these random people, of course, I’d choose him. But what makes me feel worse is that I’m not sure if I want to be with him forever. I feel like my parents pressuring me into marriage might lead me to make the wrong choice for my life.\n\n\nWork isn’t great either. It’s become so monotonous. I don’t feel challenged anymore, and it’s just become laborious. It’s not mentally rewarding. There are so many toxic people at work, which makes the environment even worse. I have job security, and there are no big issues with my job, but it still feels like too much. I spend so much time teaching coworkers—sometimes even my manager—how to do simple tasks. It’s not that they don’t know how to do it, but the toxic environment makes it difficult. People push blame on others and fail to meet deadlines, and that adds to the frustration.\n\n\nIn my love life, I don’t feel content either. If I’m being honest with myself, I can see how my personal patterns are affecting my relationship. This is my first boyfriend, and I don’t really know what to expect from a relationship after two years. But I’m still being forced into marriage. My parents are sending my photos to random men they find on matrimonial sites \"who will match our social status and is of our caste\", and they’re even passing my phone number to strangers. When I try to talk to them about it, it’s like talking to a wall. They’re determined to choose who I marry, and that’s exactly what they’ve told me. I wish I were exaggerating. Yes they know about my boyfriend, who according to them do not meet their social standards so is a big no no.\n\n\nOn top of everything, I thought that talking to my father about one of my deepest childhood traumas would help. I thought it would bring me closure, but it backfired. It hurt me even more than I can describe. I spent years coming to terms with what happened, but I foolishly believed that talking about it would give me peace. Instead, it feels like an open wound. And my family has moved on as though nothing happened—like I never tried to share my trauma with them, a trauma caused by them.\n\n\nDo you know how it feels when your parents put your abuser before you? \n\n\nDo you know how it feels when they prioritize the abuser who hurt you for years, someone who’s 30 years older than you? \n\n\nDo you know how it feels when your father decides to give that abuser his liver to help him live longer?\n\n\nDo you know how it feels to be forced to take care of your abuser because your parents make you do it?\n\n\nDo you know how it feels?\n\n\nI don’t know what it feels like to be loved. All I know is that I feel empty. I don’t know what to do to feel better. I don’t know how to feel anything other than sadness and hopelessness. If you saw me in person, you would never guess how broken I am inside. People assume I’m happy, and that just makes me feel worse. But I let them think I’m happy.",

In February I experienced a traumatic event in my family, got super depressed and used edibles on the weekend to cope with it. I quit that routine in July. I’ve had symptoms since July after I had a bad panic attack (shortly after I quit the weed) but I think it’s been gradually creeping up before then as well.\n\nThe main theme BY FAR is fear of developing schizophrenia/going into psychosis. Recently some harm/contamination thoughts have popped up but it’s not as bad as the main theme. \n\nThis week has just been particularly stressful because I’m starting classes for the last semester of my senior year of college and because I was so nervous about seeing the psychiatrist. She said my symptoms sounded like OCD and diagnosed me, but I can’t let go of the doubt and anxiety. What if I really am crazy or go crazy? I constantly find myself looking at things to “confirm” what I’m seeing/hearing and my anxiety gets super intense whenever I think about anything related to schizophrenia or psychosis. Also get deja vu, too. Browsing on reddit makes the rumination and anxiety so much worse.\n\nI was on Prozac but went off it a couple months ago because I didn’t like how it made me feel detached/unreal. Trying again temporarily though because I’ve noticed it helps some of the anxiety and its going to be a few more weeks until I can get new medication sorted out. Have been seeing a therapist since September.\n\nI’m just feeling so overwhelmed and don’t know what to do. My parents know about the OCD but not much about my symptoms. I want to tell them everything so bad but I’m worried they’ll think I’m crazy. Any advice would please be appreciated <3 thank you",

    "selftext": "Part 1\n\nHi, I'm not really sure how to start this, but here we are I guess.\n\nI'll begin to say that I am a survivor of child abuse and SA. Its the unfortunate truth and although I keep running from it, I cannot seem to be able to escape from the hellhole this has led me to. I was physically abused, pumped with medication to keep me quiet, gaslit, and raised to know that this was my fault and that my simple existence made me a monster worth being told she should have died at birth. I was a quiet kid who loved reading and creative stuff, I never understood why my birthgivers hated me so much. I come from a wealthy family where expectations and appearances are all that matter, I was the trophy child, third parent and punching ball for years. To me, this was normal. I believed them when they said it was my fault and loved them even more for tolerating my presence. I was their biggest advocate and protected their dirty secrets for years. I behaved as if nothing was wrong outside, but they slowly tore me apart. Between the ages of 6 to 18, I developed bulimia, then anorexia, had multiple broken bones, was diagnosed with severe anxiety/ panic disorders, depression, heart issues and suicidal tendencies. I tried to end my days 3 times before the age of 13. At 16, I saw a therapist, who taught me that I wasn't a monster for wanting to be loved. I was an honours' student, racked up medals and trophies, always known to go the extra mile to be perfect. Inside I hated myself so much that I had trouble looking in a mirror and used boiling water to burn my stomach and thighs because even the slightest bit of fat added to my hideousness. \n\nI wasn't perfect; sometimes I messed up, and sometimes I was just a normal kid. That shouldn't have given them the right to hurt me as they did. I behaved, never smoked a cigarette or tried drugs, sure I drank a little alcohol but at sleepovers, surrounded with friends. I was quiet and drew a lot with my headphones glued to my ears when not studying. I don't think I was so bad. But they tore apart everything that made me human to make me theirs, and even today; I have trouble recollecting if I was really as bad as they claimed.\n\n  \nAt 17, after years of empty promises of change, watching my father lay on his knees in front of me, begging for forgiveness one too many times before hitting me again, I blew up. He tried to hit me again, I pushed him away and fled. I called my mother telling her he was trying to grab me to hurt me, she replied with \"I will always love you and be on your side.\", followed with a picture of my sister that she had taken to Disneyland saying \"Look how pretty your sister is!\" I escaped and slept at a friend's house that night, still in shock. I can't remember how I got back home the next morning, but he wasn't there anymore. That's when I went crazy. I grabbed a kitchen knife and a chair, sat in front of the door and waited for 3 hours until he would come back. At the time, I was not even myself, my brain was screaming that it was me or him; that if he dared to hit me again, one of us would leave this world, and it wouldn't be me. My friend grew panicked when he understood where I was and called me again and again. The screaming ringtone of my phone is what \"woke me up\".",

It didn't help that my mom was very strict with not letting me out when me out when I was younger, therefore I feel behind people my age socially. I had a few incidents happen to me when I was younger which made me insecure. I resulted to smoking weed for self healing methods. From the age of 16 to now (22) I have been smoking nearly daily to numb my feelings and those thoughts. It is making me extremely antisocial. I'm trying to quit. I tend to self sabotage my life a lot. For instance, I neer had a girlfriend, even though on multiple occassions I had girls be interested in me, but I push them away because I'm scared of being vulnerable and I think I'm too weird. I convince myself that they wont want me anyways and that me having zero experience will make them disappointed and uninterested. Therefore, I feel like I'm going crazy and whenever I try to make a change, I ruin it on myself. Some days I feel like I'm going to be alone forever and amount to nothing. I tend to listen to the constant negative talk in my head. I feel like a loser. I had so many chances to better my life but I ruin it.",

I stopped counseling in August when i felt my dv counselor was becoming a shell of a person and I was just talking the whole time without much feedback or support. Now I am left to deal with everything on my own and I often feel I am super close to reaching a breaking point. A person can only handle so much.\n\nI was catfished by an ex 7 years ago when he pretended to be a female on Instagram in order to attempt to ship me back to him when he realized I found someone new and was moving on. I told \"her\" no thank you and that I am not interested in him anymore. He was also the one to break up with me so none of it makes sense to me logically, then again I don't think this guy functions based on logic - stalkers usually don't. the icing on the cake was that the pics he used to catfish me were of a girl he cheated on me with when we were together for all of 9 months (short relationship). I was naïve at that time and didn't think it was a catfish account until months later when \"she\" realized I wasn't going to go running back to my ex. at this point, she began telling me she is bi-sexual and found me attractive (a desperate attempt to feel connected to me or maybe sabotage my new relationship maybe? I will never know why he did that i guess)..she also told me she sells nudes to rich men on the internet and they cashapp her money and she can help me get into this type of work if Im ever interested. At this point I knew this has to be a man being creepy and a catfish..but i was in too much denial to accept that my ex would do such a thing (even tho this catfish had his phone #) so i allowed myself to believe it was the actual girl (after all I texted my ex to tell him the girl was requesting to be instagram friends and he told me to add her if i want and warned me she is crazy)..I wanted to believe he has good morals and would not be the face behind the account..\n\nhe was... things escalated quite a bit. I attempted on several occassions over the last few years to make police reports and left the station in tears because I never received help. my partner called me crazy two years ago when i told him my ex sent me a photo of a knife. he said I was crazy and nobody wants to \"fucking\" hurt me. ofc i took that to police and they bluntly told me i could go to the magistrate office to get a warrant for his arrest but he will likely be released in a day and go to court later on so he would be free and will be more angry and likely try to hurt me..i also mentioned to my sisters and parents and they all treated it like some type of joke and never brought it up again..my sisters even said im overthinking and its some spam from insgtagram..but he created numerous new phone #s each time i blocked a # and followed me on tiktok making accounts pretending to be me, messaged my friends and family asking for photos of me. he even showed up outside of my home and that wasnt enough to get a police report..An irresponsible counselor suggested i try to meet my ex in a public setting to confront him. i met with him for food. he offered me food and i did not accept anything from him. i was too scared to confront him so i confronted him in texts after some time of gathering evidence and he freaked out. he has mentally abused me so much that Im now stuck in a situationship that is aggressive and sexual.

The thesis was miserable, my ADHD makes it tough to care about long-term projects and my social anxiety made it hard to reach out to professors for help.

    "title": "I am becoming obsessed with and emotionally dependent on my new friend. What can I do to stop this without sacrificing the friendship?",
    "selftext": "A few months ago, I made a new friend. As a neurodivergent person, I struggle a lot with making friends - despite putting myself out there, I only rarely connect with others. That’s 1. why I hope to find a way out of my problematic behavior without ending the friendship and 2. probably also why I’m facing this problem. I am generally quite lonely and making a new friend is a special situation for me, which I have little experience with.\n\nI have recently found myself increasingly obsessed with my new friend. Not in a crush way - I have tested that by trying to force myself to fantasize about us getting together and, no, definitely not attracted to him. The obsession more so shows in a way that I think about him in many situations every day, even though those situations have no connection with him at all. For example, whatever it is that I do, my brain wants to think of a way that I can tell him about it and initiate a conversation. I stop myself from doing that, but the thoughts don’t seem to go away. Wanting to talk to him is on my mind at least once every waking hour. I look at snap map (just the general map, not tapping on his bitmoji) at random times of the day to see if he is home - and if I see that he is somewhere else, I get this nagging thought that he is hanging out with his better, cooler, not neurodivergent friends. If I send him a snap and he doesn’t reply, I get super sad and it feels like my day is ruined. When he does reply or snaps/messages me first (which he does sometimes, it’s actually not a one-sided connection), it makes my entire day, but it also triggers even more obsessive thinking about him.\n\nSo far, I think I have been able to play it “cool”, not shower him with messages and at least make the impression that I am a normal person with my own social life and hobbies. But I am afraid that if I do not disrupt these obsessive thoughts and emotional dependence soon, it will start showing in the way I interact, thereby damaging the friendship. Also, I’m afraid this will eventually take an actual toll on my mental health.\n\nI understand everyone who wants to tell me to cut contact and I have thought about this as well. However, I believe that my behavior could repeat with the next friendship I make, so I would like to try and treat this as a learning opportunity. In addition, my new friend really is a very kind person and I do not want to end a friendship without trying to work on myself first.",

After 1.5~ years I still don't know what makes me suffer so much. Every night after i sleep my lower stomach hurts like hell and I sit on toilet for at least 1 hour. When it comes to wiping it takes at least half of an hour because of my obsessive thoughts about being dirty after specific acts like eating, defecating and touching an object that I thouched in a few days -last one is not as frequent as others. Every time I defecate I have to take a shower afterwards. I feel sad 90%~ of the time. I can feel a bit better when I am with my friends. My family almost never tries to help other than telling me to do things I can't do at the moment like getting outside and having my breakfast in a cafe. When i say that i can't do it they shout and insult me. I talk to myself or a recorded podcast like i am talking to another person when my friends are not availabe at the moment which is most of the time. I haven't told many things. I wish I was brave enough to kill myself but Unfortunately I'm not. I hope I didn't do something wrong by posting this.",

    "selftext": "My mental health journey has been so crazy. Two years ago I really had hope. Everything was so great, I thought life would get better. I thought by now everything would be more or less fine. I knew so much about my beliefs, what my childhood did to me, understood so much.\nI didn't even think about my college time ending.\nThen I had the worst internship of my life. It wasn't jut that internship. It was moving back in with my mother at that time.\nI was triggered every day, all the time, I couldn't take it anymore, got back to self harm, maladaptive daydreaming and not speaking about what I feel, pushing everything down because I couldn't handle it. I stopped reflecting, stopped therapy work.\nThat was october 2022 - April 2023. After that everything went so fucking downhill. After the internship ended I swore that I would get better now. But I definitely did NOT do that. Instead I used religion as a coping mechanism, even got back in contact with my toxic father, tried getting love from him. This made my mental health much worse as ever before. I really wanted to kill myself, cut almost every day, contemplated to start drinking (thankfully didn't do that at least). Meanwhile I did therapy, it was the hardest thing I ever did. I also got my bpd diagnosis. Felt like a failure all the time and now I'm here. 2025, still not better. I hate myself. I wanted to heal so fucking bad, I wanted to be happy, not live after the things I learned, I fought so so hard to not be like my parents. But i dont think I am able to do it. The bpd diagnosis is so fucking discouraging sometimes. I have to love and accept myself but I can't live authentically and intuitively. I always have to mistrust my brain. It is so fucking hard. Also I dont have a fucking second to breath anymore, not living alone anymore (boyfriend). Constantly triggered, i mean fucking constantly. Fear of abandonment, fear of getting screamed at at work, not feeling good enough because I dont do enough therapy homework, I don't show myself grace and I hate myself for it. Now my therapy is \"done\" because Insurance says its over now, you know. I made big steps learned a lot yes but I still feel like a fucking piece of shit because I dont feel good. WHY IS LIFE SO SHIT??? i dont wanna do this. I need a break.\n\nNow I dont even have my therapist anymore, he would remind me that it's okay to have problems, that I made a lot of progress and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. He would tell me to relax now, be proud that I still live. That I made it until this point. He would tell me to do something relaxing, because I just turned my bachelor thesis in. He would tell me I am allowed to do something fun now. He would tell me to keep doing my things I learned in therapy. That they will help me feel better, think realistically again. But it's so fucking hard.\n\nI just can't tell myself this sometimes. Back then, before my internship, everything was better. I could bring myself to say good things to myself, to love myself.\nI was always hard on myself. Thats how I learned to make progress. How can I make progress when I'm not hard on myself? \nOh I hate how hard this fucking shit is\nCan anyone relate? I feel so alone in this. I don't fit in with the normal people and I don't fit in with borderline people because I'm more reflected on my shit. I know a whole lot but it doesnt mean its not still hard as fuck.\nI just need people to talk about my thoughts, to process. People who really understand.\n\n",

I thought maybe putting it into words here could help me process everything or get advice from people who’ve been through something similar.  \n\nHere’s what I’ve been experiencing:  \n- Sadness: I constantly feel melancholic, and sometimes I cry without knowing why. I used to be such a bubbly and cheerful person, but all of that feels like it’s gone. Emotionally, I’m just...flat.  \n- Anxiety: I feel this constant underlying worry about everything, even things that shouldn’t be stressing me out.  \n- Lack of energy/motivation: I’ve always been a top student, and while I’m still doing well academically, my results have started to degrade. I struggle to find the energy to keep pushing myself.  \n- Temper outbursts: I’ve been yelling at people I care about and hurting them with my words. Later, I realize how wrong I was, and I apologize, but I hate that I keep doing this.  \n- Irritability: Even small things set me off, and I don’t know how to stop being so easily annoyed.  \n- Sleep issues: My sleep is all over the place. Some nights I sleep less than 5 hours, and other days I can’t get out of bed for over 10 hours.  \n- Appetite changes: I’ve lost a lot of weight because I either have no appetite or I forget to eat altogether.  \n- Isolation: I’ve been withdrawing from everyone. As soon as I get home, I just isolate myself from friends, family—everyone.  \n\nI don’t know why this is happening, but it feels like I’m losing myself. I just want to feel normal again.  \n\nI used to go to psychotherapy for few months but due to technical reasons my psychotherapist has been away for a month now and won't return until the end of February and I don't want to start therapy with any other therapist because I am not ready to go through process of introduction again.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar or has advice on what I can do, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.  \n\nThank you for reading.

I feel like the meds haven't been as helpful as I hoped, and I want to try a more holistic approach that aligns better with my lifestyle.\n\nI live in Canada, and I'm wondering:- \n\n1. Do I need a referral from my family doctor to see a psychologist or therapist who specializes in dealling with ADHD in non-pharma way?\n\n2. What non-medication strategies have worked for you? (Cognitive behavioral therapy, coaching, lifestyle changes, etc.)\n\n3. Are there any affordable or publicly funded options available, or is private therapy my only real choice?\n\n4. Have any of you tried online ADHD coaching or therapy platforms like MindBeacon or BetterHelp? Were they helpful?\n\n5. Any recommendations for specific professionals or clinics that focus on ADHD treatment beyond meds?\n\n6. Do I even need professional help? I'm at the end of my wits and I'm starting to think our parents were right and it really is just laziness and lack of discipline. \n\nI’m also open to suggestions about practical day-to-day habits, productivity hacks, or any strategies that have made a real difference for you.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can share!

Then it was the talent portion now, it was supposed to be an interpretive improvised sword danceon the spot, but then while I was doing the fast moves I didn't notice I holding the sheath and then the real sword fell to the ground instead, then when I was running to get it I almost tripped. And not to mention everything was messy, it didn't have emotion because I was numb after the things that happened, it was supposed to HAVE emotion for it to work as a dance on the spot, but then it's all ruined and it became some random dance that I did to humiliate myself. \nAnd next was the announcement of 1st runner up, I was holding hands with another contestant and then my number was called which means she was the Ms., I thought it was an unspoken rule to hug whoever you were holding hands with and I even was about to hug her, it was noticeable but she just kinda pushed me and went to run to hug one of the judges, I know that wasn't her intention because I know the thrill of winning but I'm still kinda offended, and hopefully none of my schoolmates use Reddit cause lawddd if they see this I'm gonna get snitched on, but 2nd and 3rd runner ups were so nice to me so I had to give my love to them by having a group hug while they were crowning the Mr. and Ms. While the guys (2nd and 3rd) also gave their respects and love to each other the same time I did, \nBut ever since all the emotional stuff the happened after Intrams, I still think about my sword dance. I could get over it alone but then I always think what if my schoolmates bring it up because it was SO EMBARRASSING, whenever I think about the sword falling, whenever I think about if it was messy and funny to the audience when it isn't supposed to be, whenever I think how I almost tripped, whenever I think about how I was pushed. And the fact that I can't even LISTEN to the song I put for my talent portion, that's how embarrassing it is and I fucking hate it.",

I started to have nightmares at about week 6 but it seems these are slowly getting better as well..  I also started some digestive issues such as grumbly tummy and feeling of more gas inside me around the 6 week mark..However 3 days ago I started to get quite bad diarrhoea to the point that whatever or whenever I eat comes out the other end I have experienced no stomach cramps or any other feeling of being unwell besides this. This is odd to me as many of the symptoms I experienced started the day after I started to take it, and it seems odd to me that this would suddenly start after 8 weeks of taking the medication, especially as at the start while I experienced on and off nausea for a while I did not have diarrhoea and as a rule I have never suffered with it.. At the moment this seems to be the only symptom I am experiencing (if it is a symptom). This leads to my next question has anyone else experienced symptoms on this medication that have just popped up out of nowhere and were not there at the start but developed later after taking the medication? \n\nI’m asking as I’m not too sure what to do whether to book a doctor’s appointment or just chalk this up to something random that will go away.. Can anyone offer any thoughts on what I should do or if I should be concerned? I should also mention I’m a stress head and am wondering whether this is a potential random result of stress but not too sure. \n\nFor added context I am 18 years old (F) and from the UK. \n\nMany thanks :) ",

    "selftext": "Some backstory, I used to be the happiest most carefree person ever my whole life. I've had my struggles in life, like everyone else, but I was always so positive and always picked myself back up. After I got married last year, my mental health started to spiral. My husband is wonderful and I love him, but the stress of everything changing, moving away from my parents, paying all of the bills, etc... has really taken a toll on me. I am always feeling stressed and anxious. I was always a dreamer and imagined such an amazing life for myself, but now that I am in adulthood and working and doing all of the things that I have to do, I just feel disappointed in life. \n\nI have so much to be thankful for and I always remind myself of that, but I cannot help myself feeling like there is no point to living. I am always sabotaging my happiness. Whenever my husband and I have an issue, my mind just goes to the worst place and I question our entire relationship. If we fight, my mind goes directly to divorce (I know that this is unstable by the way, I don't take it out on him because I know that its stupid, but I usually just wallow in sadness until the feeling passes). If he is ever not super kind an affectionate to me, or if he is in a bad mood, I feel miserable. My husband is super sweet and affectionate to me, but if he is ever in a bad mood, I let it ruin my day. I want to make it clear that I know that this is a ME problem and that I have issues, but I can't help but let everything effect me. Sometimes I just cry for no reason, and then I get over it. He can say one little thing to me, and I will lock myself in the bathroom and cry and contemplate my entire life, and then an hour later, I'm back to normal. \n\nOverall, I just feel like life is too much. I am so anxious about everything and I end up crying a lot. I feel like I am on an emotional roller coaster and I just want to get off of it and feel peace. To make matters worse, I found out in the first week of the year that my position at work is being dissolved and that I won't have a job after February. Now I have a real reason to be miserable.. My husband has been so kind and supportive with this and is always encouraging me that I will find something better but honestly, I don't even know what I want to do anymore. Nothing feels worth it to me and I just always feel a heaviness that is keeping me from really doing something with my life. I thought that I was going to be a musician, or travel the world and be a translator (I speak 3 languages), or do some other amazing thing. Now I work in an office doing some BS that doesn't matter, and I'll probably end up in a similar job, doing some other BS for a boss that doesn't care to remember my name. I used to think that my work would bring me joy, and now its what is robbing my joy from me. \n\n  \nI also just feel lost in my relationships. I don't have a ton of friends, but during covid, being locked inside with my family, I got very close to my parents and we used to laugh and talk all the time. Now when I'm with them, I don't even know what to say. I feel awkward and distant. I feel like I am becoming angry and irritable because I just feel so helpless sometimes. I complain about things, when before, nothing phased me, I was always happy go lucky.. What is wrong with me ? How can I be happy again ?",

And now my memory is worse than ever. I am in a constent mental fog and unable to realise where I am (in time and space) what I am supposed to be doing in life, AND I have a lot of false memories. It got more noticeable when I would spend a lot of time with my partner and he would be confused at what I was refering to sometimes, and I realised how much false memories I had. \n\nIt is a very distressing experience because I am experiencing a memory that is as real and clear and life affecting as a real one but it simply didn't happened, I don't know how it happens or why and I have no idea how to improve this or even fact check my memories. \n\nIt makes me an unreliable source and hard to trust, also it is harder to believe my experiences as a person which is quite heart crushing with a lot of things, I don't feel like I experience reality like everyone else and it makes me feel alienated, not trustworthy and very easy to gaslight and manipulate.\n\n  \nThanks for reading and if you have any idea of what could be causing this i'll be very happy, as I have no ways of getting any psychological help right now",

Rarely do I tell people about my condition, but I have a close friend  I told a year ago. Fast forward about six months ago, apparently he took some free online test that he scored a “38 on” which supposedly means he’s autistic too, and ever since then he calls himself my “Tism Twin”. Yes I’m aware it’s a spectrum, but I also feel that taking an online test (free at that) isn’t a proper diagnosis; but merely a starting point to see if you’re actually autistic.\n\nAdditionally, he says he has ADHD like me, but also has never been diagnosed or medicated (I’ve been on Ritalin since 1996, then Adderal, currently on 70mg Vyvanse). He has a great job with health insurance, works 4-5 days a week, but won’t see a doctor. It’s honestly offensive to me every time he sends me an autism meme etc at this point.

    "selftext": "Something I've learned on my own mental health journey is that it is legitimate to try a certain kind of advice and find it doesn't work for you. However, after you have done some foundational work with other methods, you might find that you've built yourself up to a point where the old advice that didn't work before *is* capable of working now.\n\nAffirmations is the big one for me. Years ago, they didn't work at all for me and I thought they were kind of bullshit. I wasn't in a place where just repeating something I didn't feel like was true would change my mindset, it just felt condescending and like I was being expected to say a magic word over and over.\n\nWhat I needed at the time was to first understand that all the ways that my family was treating me were not normal. I already knew to some extent that my parental figures were abusive, but reading \"Running On Empty\" by Jonice Webb still opened my eyes and shocked me with *how much* they were doing wrong that I didn't realize wasn't normal or okay. It was from that reference point that I was able to start tracing the patterns in the way I thought about myself and the world, and see which ones originated from abusive treatment and therefore were not trustworthy.\n\nA lot more happened in between then and now, but long story short, affirmations have started to become useful to me now that I understand them less as a \"magic spell,\" and more as a reminder of something that is objectively true but that I tend to lose sight of. I also now have more respect for the power of repetition, because I understand that it's essentially just abusive conditioning but in reverse: I came to believe terrible things about myself because other people repeated them to me over and over, so there's no reason I can't use their own methods to undo that damage. I just first had to have a foundational understanding of *why* the things I was repeating to myself were true, and why the bad things I was repeating were false.\n\nI guess this is just a reminder to stay open-minded, and don't think that just because something isn't working for you right now does not mean that you are untreatable or \"hopeless,\" or to write that method off completely and potentially miss out on its benefits entirely. Sometimes you're just not ready for it at the moment, and it will be something you can graduate to later.",

We manage to make things work since we see each other around twice a month since we have conflicting schedules. However, the past few months we’ve been noticing how she would always get stressed about a lot of stuff and she’s anxious all the time. Her anxiety would then lead to a mental breakdown. I am trying my best to be there for her through video calls and I try to reassure her by telling her that it is anxiety and it will pass. I also tried searching online on what works such as naming 3 things to touch hear and feel and etc. I just feel like I really can’t do much from far away. Of course it is my choice to do so because I love her, although I cannot lie, it is affecting me too. Recently it was just full of negative talks, I can’t help but be worried too and I just feel like whatever I do it is just not enough. I just feel drained too. I don’t know what to do.\n\nJust earlier, she told me that she appreciates what I do whenever she’s having an attack, however she said that it just doesn’t work for her. She told me that it might work for someone else but it just doesn’t work on her. That makes me a little sad and disappointed with myself because I just want to help but I can’t do anything. And it also added to that feeling of being drained because even if I’m exerting effort, it’s not helping my gf.\n\nPlease help me figure this out and let me hear your thoughts. You can also tell me if I’m looking at this in a wrong way. I just really want to help my girlfriend.",

My main concern though is weve been dating less than a month and he seems to be jumping ahead of himself. So what I mean is by like date two he was already talking about meeting family and by date three saying how he missed me. He's wanting to go on a date every 2-3 days, but Ive ushered him to doing one date a week. I just feel like he doesnt know me well enough yet to warrant this much excitement.\n\nAnyways for some reason his excitement over me has made me anxious and honestly I think is weirdly triggering my PTSD because I was panicky last night and this morning about it. Subjectively I think its very cute, very sweet, but I guess Im just waiting for the other shoe to drop? I have been guilty to testing some of his claims to see if he is lying and have found him to be truthful each time.\n\nI know this panic, trying to find some fault in him, etc. is a result of my PTSD and is shitty. I would love some advice from people who are or have been in this similar situation. For those with PTSD, how did you self sooth, navigate conversations, etc?

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to know if anyone relates to something about my past and present life that I am now trying to go through in therapy but that makes me feel so alone because it’s so hard to hear about similar experiences.\n\nHas any of you been living a large chuck of your adult life existing and functioning well from the outside, but struggling to find a sense of self and purpose and almost as if your existence was inexorably tied to that of your parents? It sounds weird but I’ll try and explain.\n\nI am 32, only child of two older than average parents (mom 39y, dad 50y older). Most of my childhood memories are happy but I don’t recall spending much time with anybody else than my parents – my wider family every now and then during the holidays, a few acquaintances, but there no regular social interactions with other families and kids. I did everything with my parents: playing, trips, holidays. I think I was showered with love and attention as if I was their perfect gem.\n\nI was a very uncharacteristic teen: I felt totally unprepared to handle my teenage years, to be spontaneous with peers, the dating scene (I never got asked out), and I felt I only belonged at home. One of the most striking aspects is that I never sought independence, discovery, adventure. I remember feeling like a retired person. I had friends but never got intimate with them. I wasn’t left alone but always felt my relationship with most of them was ‘forced’, and I got used to some 'benign' mockery that must have had quite some impact on me with hindsight. I'd rather spend time with my parents than with my friends. And I wasn’t really questioning all this at the time: it was just “happening” and I mostly found it ok.\n\nThe turning point was my Erasmus trip: When I started living away from my parents I freaked out, was unable to cope emotionally with being in the driver’s seat of my life for things such as getting to know new people, sharing a house with roommates, discovering a new city… all felt overwhelming and I was only looking forward to going back home. A terrible awakening. I know there should be no shame but I felt deeply ashamed and alone, different, somehow wrong.\n\nWhen I moved abroad again, surprisingly, I didn’t feel I needed my parents for my survival. I’ve spent all my years abroad since, with highs and lows, without missing my parents anymore, but with an ever-present sense that I am missing something, that I can never belong, that I am not really driven to build a life primarily for myself. It’s a very debilitating feeling at times. The very word ‘life’ used to scare me as a kid and it still does now.\n\nEver since I started living abroad I developed a very weird relationship with my parents, where we’re in contact but I can rarely be authentic with them… like as if I “decided” that who I became around them could never be a fulfilled person and I rejected that legacy, but also I feel like I don’t have the tools and the ‘living force’ inside me to create my own story, like there’s something telling me that deep down I could only ever belong with them and with nobody/nowhere else.\n\nThat’s it in a nutshell. Has anyone else felt like this? I am wondering if there is a ‘label’ for any of the above and if I am dealing with a mental health condition which my upbringing is responsible for… definitely going to try and figure it out in therapy but I guess I wanted to see if someone else relates to this in any way.\n\nThank you if you read this far! Cheers.",

Listening to her story led me to feel so disheartened about my own journey. It got me thinking how excited I used to be about my future, my plan to become an OT by 25 years old, a bright future. I've been mentally spiraling all day about this and feel like I have to quit my program and move states to feel better about myself. To have a fresh start. For more context, I've been wanting to move states even before quitting grad school but the feeling has simply ramped up since quitting. Would it be that bad to just quit and move? I feel so stuck in the state I live in bc of school and finances but I was thinking of just moving in with my aunt while I'm in an OTA or OT program that's near her place in a new state. I feel like I can't be happy doing this anymore. Considering this post and my other two posts, should I defer school until I figure some more out? Idk why I'm feeling this way. I'm sorry if this post is vague btw.. my mind is chaotic rn.",

I cannot get it out, I cannot form my life into words.

And I’m addicted to being sad, so I don’t even know what I want. \n\nI want to allow myself to wallow, but I want help at the same time. My emotions are all over the place so when I’m not numb I’m either happy, angry, or self sabotaging. And it’s not in a bipolar way at all, far from it, it’s in a subtle and pathetic way and I’m going to stop with this part because I don’t know where I’m going with it. \n\nBasically, I just feel alone and I don’t know what to do. It’s been this way for years. God knows I can’t do this on my own, I’ve tried, and I spent a year waiting on everyone else to help, that didn’t work, so I wanted to try professional help. Then there’s the whole process of finding a therapist you work with, then opening up, being human even though I’m unable to be human even with my own family and closest friends, not because of some ideology but because I just CANT.",

I stuck it out for some stupid reason instead of looking to finish sooner. I got my citizenship my senior year. I went straight into LPN school and dropped out around my second term, I felt very discriminated. I went back in the summer of 2023 when of my amazing instructors became the new director and begged me to come back and finish. And so I did, and guess what the instructor who discriminated against me quit when we talked about her actions of being a bully, and my new instructor stood up for us and told her we would no longer use her for clinical. Now I’m a LPN who landed up a job at my local small hospital. Life has been very sad here, very different from home. Very dull. I would love to trade positions with anyone because I yearn to go back home. America has brought nothing but issues for me to the table. ",

I told them that if they weren’t happy in the relationship, and they’ve tried everything, they should end it. \n\nThey wanted to but quickly talked about how they had a crush on someone, I eventually asked if it was me and they said yes. I told them that I like them too but I was not having any form of a romantic relationship with them until they told their boyfriend. They agreed, as they know how sucky it is to be cheated on, so we aren’t dating but we know we like each other.\n\nI’ve heard about emotional cheating, only time we’ve had “deep conversations” was the first and second time they expressed frustration with their boyfriend and I gave advice, first time I told them to talk it through with him and try to find a solution, then the second time I said if they still weren’t happy maybe they should break up. As for flirting,  we never have but we’d stroke each others faces in the game (vrchat) but we wouldn’t hide it, we’ve done it since BEFORE they were dating and in front of him and he was fine with it, we actually did it to him and started sort if a three way face caressing situation which was funny.

I slowly was able to stop needing my extra anxiety med for my panic attacks, and then over this last year I was able to stop taking a couple of my meds I had been on. However I’m not sure what’s changed but last Wednesday I started having panic attacks again out of nowhere, and for no reason. I reached out to my psychiatrist, and they said they needed to see me in order to talk about my medication, so I made an appointment but the soonest I could get in was the 29th. I started a new job last month, and have no sick time until my first 90 days are up at the company, but after having panic attacks all day I reluctantly took a day off to recoup, and recover. I then made an appointment to see my therapist, but 30 minutes ahead of my appointment they cancelled on me for a family emergency. Obviously I’m not mad at them for cancelling for that reason I acknowledge that they’re human as well, and have a life. However between the panic attacks, my depression, life stresses, and work I feel like I really needed to talk with them to get stuff off my chest, and try to make sense of feelings. I’m just feeling very alone, and lost. This medicine I’m taking for my panic attacks is also making me feel like I’m in a dissociative state all day everyday, and I just can’t Lee taking this med like this, I’m praying there’s another way.

I don't even know how to start this normally, so i'll just give a small backstory: i almost attempted suicide when i was 11 due to trauma and those thoughts kept going on until i reached my lowest at 13(8th grade), i was in a constant state of dissociation and depression and it was terrifying.   \nSometimes i still think about suicide, but i don't have any intention. Everything would be easier if i could just stop existing though.  \n  \nTook me 5 years, but the period between september and now is probably the happiest i've ever been.  \n  \nAnyway, there's this hole inside of me that i can feel 24/7. Sometimes it makes me wanna throw up. It doesn't matter if i'm laughing with friends or whatever, it's just there. I know this sounds contradictory, but it's only gotten more noticeable these last weeks, i've been zoning out a lot more and it's just harder to enjoy stuff. I also get flashbacks from when i was 11 again. I'm constantly tired, my eyes always feel glossy which is really annoying especially with makeup on.\n\nYesterday i found my old diary that i used for school from 8th grade so i started reading through it. About 10 minutes in, i started punching the book, i threw it on the floor, kicked it and then paced around the house while crying hysterically and punching my head. Then i cried again yesterday night while trying to sleep.  \nI don't know what triggered that, but it's not the first time. It happened last week while i was getting ready to go out with some friends, i started crying and screaming while straightening my hair and ended up 40 minutes late. Today i almost teared up in class too.\n\nI also struggle with being an ass apparently. (hypothetical situation) At 14.50 i'm thinking my friend is the best person ever and i'm so glad we're friends and at 13.00 i feel disgusted by them because i remembered the one time they did me wrong 8 months ago.

I know after I won't be able to move for the rest of the day/s after but at the time I just can't settle and stop. I don't know if it's me self harming in a way or somethings else. It's like I kind of feel manic and once I've completed what ever task it is I look back and don't know how I have even done it physically as other than this I struggle with so many things physically due to my health. I can be in tears while completing the task where i am in so much pain at the time and will be obsessively thinking about what has happened while doing it. I also tell myself that the physical pain is nothing compaired to the mental pain i am feeling to make myself keep going. Does anyone else have any experience of this? I did mention it to my therapist but I'm seeing her for something specific so it's not really something we have time to go into fully. Thank you for reading ",

    "selftext": "I’m 64 and have had meds and multiple therapies to try to live positively with my depression and anxiety. All therapies which were helpful include talk, dialectic behavior therapy, EMDR and hypnosis. However, no matter what I’ve done, I’ve still had some things I couldn’t process including sexual kissing and touching from my step grandfather. I live in Oregon in the US, where, in a clinic, you can use psilocybin legally. So to try to understand why I didn’t have emotions around the abuse, and yet, still can’t stop thinking about it, I tried mushrooms today. Oh, let me add, today I drank a mushroom tea at a legal clinic and was with a certified psilocybin facilitator. But my big take away, was it wasn’t my feeling or memories about the abuse that was stuck, but the feelings of my abuser. With him, I felt his overpowering lust, desire to possess and consume me, to have me to himself completely. And though not appropriate also a form of passionate love I had never experienced before or since.\nIt was HIS emotions that got stuck in me. My 10 year old self didn’t understand them or what to do with them, so they were dammed up and I’ve been carrying his buried emotions in my body all these years. Today, I felt them and could let them start to flow through me and out. Although I’ve had a few romantic relationships I was never able to truly feel their romantic love pass through, because my abusers “love” was blocking it. I hope this makes sense and doesn’t sound hokey. It is a mind blowing, life changing understanding for me. I feel hope to move through and forward and some good days may be yet to come. ",

Never been good at writing or explaining myself so please excuse me if i seem to ramble or don’t make any sense. \n\n\nA little bit about me: I’m 23 soon to be 24. Been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and possible bpd however that’s not a confirmed diagnosis; just something the doctor said to me when I went through something traumatic a few years ago. \n\nThe majority of my childhood was abusive (TW) and ultimately I was put into care when I was 15. Sucks but it was for the best. I’ve struggled with mental health all my teenage years which resulted in multiple suicide attempts (TW) and was medicated on and off for about 8 years. I guess the picture forming is coming clearer now so let’s move forward…\n\nFast forward to the present; I feel like I’m in a lot better place than I was 2 years ago! Yay! I’m starting to focus on myself a lot more and starting to listen to what I want rather than what pleases other people. I’ve made really positive changes to my lifestyle such as eating better foods, having a better self care routine learning my boundaries, learning how to communicate more effectively and how to become a better person. However, since I spoke to the doctor and his mention of bpd I have this part of me that thinks maybe this is a manic stage and I’m going to go back down on the rollercoaster. Which I definitely don’t want as I feel at peace with myself. On the other hand, another part of me says this is what you have been building up for; the hours I’ve spent researching, self reflecting and listening to that little voice in my head; that this is all a step in the right direction. \n\nMy life isn’t perfect right now there is a lot of stress and up & down moments but who’s life is smooth sailing? Part of the fun right?! \n\n\nSo my question is… Is this me finally healing or is my mental health taking another hit because of the stress I’m under? Is the voice in my head correct, is it even normal to have voice in my head? (it feels like my sub conscious is talking to me) or am I going completely bonkers?? \n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far and I’ve not bored you. Thankyou and thankyou for taking interest . We’re all in this together. ",

    "selftext": "This happened a few months ago. It was a normal day at college, nothing noticeable happened and the classes were over, everyone was either hanging at the nearest bus stop and the shop near it or on the college grounds. I was about to get in my dad's car and go home, but then one girl from my group approached me. I heard quite a few people from my group planned to hang out together or something like that, just normal bonding between students, nothing that I particularly enjoy. I didn't expect anyone from my group to invite me, not because (at the time) I was some kind of an outcast, but simply because- I don't know, I guess I don't remember the last time anyone invited me to hang out, especially given the fact that previously in my school, I was widely seen as a \"weird one\" and no one really talked to me at all.\n\nCut to what actually happened. As I was about to sit in the car, this girl asked me something like \"We're going \\[somewhere\\], are you coming?\". I got a little confused and, I guess, awkward at that moment and just mumbled something akin to a \"No, thank you. I just want to go home.\". She just nodded and went on her way back to the college grounds. I didn't give this interaction much thought and just sat in the car, and we started to drive away. I think about a minute or so passed, and I realized something- I was crying. It was very weird because I realized my eyes were full of tears but I didn't want to cry at all, like my brain giving me a command to cry without an actual reason to. I had no intention of crying in the car, especially because there was another man in the back seat, and I didn't want to embarrass myself by trying to explain to my dad why I was crying out of nowhere. Of course, my dad eventually noticed there was something wrong and asked about that, thankfully, I didn't *sound* like crying so I just said something about my eyes getting teary because I was tired and I didn't have enough sleep. He believed me and said that I should go to sleep right when I got home.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what was that, even months after it happened. I didn't like or care for that girl or anyone in my group, even back then when I tried to \"be an active part of the group\". Now I barely even talk to any of them. But I'm truly curious what was that, was that a sign of my loneliness putting pressure on me? Or me barely interacting with anyone IRL for three years? Nothing like that happened to me before or after.",

    "title": "Just started college and my anxiety disorder is out of control.",
    "selftext": "Took a gap semester out of high school and started college this spring semester. I’ve always had bad anxiety but I’ve never really done anything about it because to be honest I’m scared to get help for some reason and with the relatively low stress environment that is childhood it was manageable then. Unfortunately now it’s starting to bite me in the ass with starting college. I’ve had 3 mental breakdowns this week and I’m severely failing at separating my school time from my relax time. It’s not even like I have a lot of school work (intentionally took a light course load for my first semester). I just keep on overthinking everything, thinking about how hard a class might get, thinking about classes I’ll be taking for the next 4 semesters and how hard they might be and what order I should take them, wondering how I’ll do on an exam 3 weeks from now when I’ve only ever had one class with them. \n\nI have been spending every single waking second of free time either looking up stuff about college on Reddit, looking at the required classes sheet trying to work out what classes to take, or talking to my brother or my parents about college (my brother went for same degree as me at same college). \n\nWhen stuff is difficult I tend to want to know everything there is about it before I do it to avoid failure which isn’t practical or reasonable. The issue lies in I can’t know everything about college until I complete it and that is almost acting like an error loop in my brain. I keep running around the same thoughts over and over again never coming to any worthwhile conclusion. I just stress myself out well beyond what’s healthy for college which has been harming my confidence in myself to do college. I’m literally psyching myself out of college before I’ve even done it and making myself feel miserable in the process. \n\nI knew my anxiety was going to be an issue with this rather difficult major (physics) so I already set my expectations for this degree to take longer than 4 years hence the lighter course load but it’s still not enough. I really need to work on my core anxiety itself first. Due to the stress I’ve been experiencing the past week I haven’t been drinking enough water, I haven’t been eating much of anything (lost 7 lbs already), sleeping has been difficult, and I’ve pretty much been living in constant fight or flight mode. It’s so hard for me to calm down once I get home from college and while I’m there I’m always operating on like a 6/10 anxiety level which I guess could be normal if it weren’t for my inability to stop thinking about college once I finished my work and went home. \n\nAny time I try to calm down I always loop back to looking up stuff about college. I wish I could block college from my searches or something, it’s not healthy I know that at least. \n\nI just need help with this and I don’t know where to start.",

    "selftext": "My main gripe is that I have no physical trauma per se. I used to have nightmares that my dog or family members weren’t real and were waiting to be exposed and attack. In elementary school I had some grand delusions that I was still back where I used to live and was on a Truman show esq prank channel. \n\nI used to be so afraid of my own reflection and things moving slowly in the corners of my eyes that I would sleep covering my face(still do). \n\nPart of this is from my “dream cycle” basically when I was young I found tells that my dreams were fake. Hearing about lucid dreams and wanting to get away before I knew a nightmare was coming, I used them. But this ending in me waking up from one dream into the next. Each layer more realistic until my average night was 3 layers deep. That was when things got much worse. \n\nThe concept is simple. In Between dreams Make an unstable one before the dreamer realizes boom scared awake. To get around this I acted asleep or stared at a wall. It wasn’t sleep paralysis. The lights would be on. The fan would be off. However I knew. I always avoided what I needn’t not look at. \n\nMy worst example of this was the last I can remember clearly. I woke up from a dream within a dream as usual. I checked and my watches were in the right place, my fan was on. There was sunlight coming in the window. And my phone was in my hand I slept with it in my hand, I even turned it on but didn’t unlock it. These were things that could never happen, not in my mind. But something seemed off. I sleep facing the door at least in that house. I quickly hid my phone with my finger on the volume button. I was hiding it from my father who had walked in. He said my name trying to wake me up. He turned on the light. From the switch. A switch that was clicked on already from the fan. He walks out. But I dare not open my eyes as I feel the cloth of my sheets and the button on my phone. They feel off. He brings my sister in to my room as they speculate whether I am really asleep. I can feel my eyes opening. The light from above prying into them. Before that I had been peeking looking around. But I caught a glimpse of a figure that was not human or not one I knew. I could feel its gaze from beyond my eyelids. After feeling the cloth it got me nowhere but my phone was odd. I don’t hold my grip when i sleep. This wasn’t my phone. As I felt it I realized that it was something odd and unfamiliar but soon I saw that daylight creaking thru my eyelids and the sheets that felt real. I took a gamble opening my eyes to the real world. Ever so close to my dream yet the phone was fake. The button was just my nipple that my finger must’ve caught. \n\nKnowing what seems fake could be real and Vice versus. In time I only saw myself in the mirror as a shadowy figure and a face frozen screaming. Holding all the scars that never happened. I’m weak to pain so I’ve never self harmed. I have a spot on my throat where I tried to choke myself and that fits my hand. But nothing else. \n\nI wonder if the reason my writing resembles plays is because I can only see my life and others from the seat of an audience member. I wonder if this counts as disassociation. When the characters make me feel more immersed than my life story. \n",

I've tried talking about it with them but all they want to say is that \"we are doing different things in there that your not into\" and that's fine but I miss my friends and I see them on in other areas doing things that I could be a part of and they don't invite me or think of me and that really hurts and I don't know how much longer I can keep asking for them to hang out with me before it feels like they are just doing it to pity me. I'd rather be alone than have people be with me out of pity.\n\nIn a different situation, one person that I became very close with (semi-romantic) suddenly became very distant and didn't want to hang out or message much anymore. I also brought this up to them because this wasn't a typical situation to where it was just casual ghosting, we were close enough to discuss it.

This approach risks devaluing the pain and injustice someone has gone through, focusing only on their reactions while ignoring the abuser's actions. I also think it can be counterproductive, especially for deeply traumatized people with severe mental health disorders and difficulties in expressing anger and asserting boundaries. But judging by the comments under the video, many people seem to like this advice.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Does it seem empowering to you? Or is it counterproductive?\n\nUPD: Here’s how AI suggests replacing words in that advice so that it doesn’t sound like victim-blaming and devaluation:\n\n*“My mom behaves in a way that makes me angry, and I want to learn to manage this emotion better.”*\n\n*“My mom’s actions were unfair and hurtful, and I want to find ways to protect myself so these actions affect me less.”*",

I had 2 drinks on that birthday and picked up my then 17 year old sister from someone’s house about 4 miles down the road. I got pulled over and blew a .082 BAC (legal limit is .08). I was arrested for a DUI and endangering the welfare of a child (my sister). I was in my last year of college and had just been promoted at my job. Was not able to graduate because I could not find an internship (this was required to graduate) that would take me with this charge. I also lost my job due to this. My attorney told me in 7 years I can do an expungement and move on with my life. Except 7 years went by & the endangerment charge is a charge that is never allowed to be expunged according to a recent new law. In this time, I’ve applied to any job you can think of. Even ones that claim to be felon friendly (my charge was a misdemeanor and I didn’t do jail time). Anyway, not one would hire me. So I’ve been self employed this whole time working as an aide in my town. I’ve made a wonderful name for myself but it’s not steady work and it does not provide a comfortable living. I decided to go back to school and do a major that I thought would be more flexible with my charge - I chose communications. Graduated with a 4.0. After about 800 applications in 6 months, I’ve had 2 interviews and no offer. Of course in this time, I’ve also applied to jobs that people told me don’t care about criminal history like a server. I applied to 4 server positions and was denied all of them. I had to move back home with my mom right after thanksgiving.\n\nI am miserable. I can’t provide for my child or myself. I feel guilty I brought this poor child into this mess. I feel guilty that I have to ask my parents to help pay my car insurance and phone bill. For my welfare renewal, I put 0 income because that’s what it is. Now an investigator is looking into me because she doesn’t know how I’m surviving with no income. Here’s a hint - IM NOT. I live with my MOM. I’m spending anywhere from 20-40 hours a week applying to any job I can find. She refuses to believe I can’t find any work. She flat out said I probably rather live on welfare. I couldn’t believe it. I worked hard all through high school and college and had so many goals. One night ruined it. And this woman is going to question me?! I don’t want to live like this. \n\nI get my son on the bus and go right back to sleep to avoid the deep guilt and hopelessness I feel. I had intake with a psychiatric NP yesterday. I go back next week to go over medicine options. How am I supposed to enjoy any part of my life if I can’t take care of myself and my son? Why won’t anyone look past one night and take my references into consideration? I work hard. I’m reliable. None of that matters. I literally ruined my life on my 21st birthday over two drinks. \n\nI can’t move forward with my life. I’m trapped. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy ",

Live in the perfect neighborhood for the kids regarding kindergarten, school and friends. \nWe've never been good when it comes to communication. In the start of the relationship he broke up with me, I was completely blindsided. Got back together after about 2-3 months.\n\nWe've been going to couples therapy since last fall. Here he said I have to get better in touch with my feelings so that we can form a closer emotional bond, or else he'd break up again. \nHe's been going to therapy for about a year because he realized he wasn't in touch with his feelings. He is in a much better state now and so good with the kids and feelings. Perfect dad! \n\nI've been really down and sad since we started couples therapy, feeling I wasn't good enough.  I've been going to therapy myself since late December. Realized I've been manipulative and down right mean to him several years. Guilt tripping him when he was going out with friends/colleagues. I stopped with that about 3 years ago, but he still feels guilt every time he goes out for social events and such. \n\nI've been taking the victim role in all of this. Making him feel guilty for putting us and the relationship in a really bad spot. I am no victim, I'm the abuser. \n\nI feel so bad. I'm a horrible person and don't feel I contribute with anything positive in this family. Only cleaning, cooking and making sure the kids get their lunch with them. I believe they would be better off without me. I told him that because he said he wanted to support me and know what was going on. Now I feel bad for telling him in case he now doesn't dare to break up in fear of the suicidal risk. I told him not to worry about that, he replied that if there would be a break up he would have his therapist to help him through it. That feels like a comfort for me aswell, I know he and the kids are in good hands. \n\nI feel I have no control in this situation, so I've started eating less. I don't have any appetite, it might just be anxiety/feeling down or side effects of ADHD medication. \n\nI don't have any plans,  just hoping I won't wake up from a sleep.   ",

    "title": "I’ve been trying to find the right support for years but it’s caused more trauma",
    "selftext": "It's been this way for my whole life. I have PTSD and a concoction of other issues (ADHD, anxiety, and depression). I've tried every stimulant and SSRI I can imagine exists, and I've had nothing but adverse effects and reactions to medication. Therapy hasn't helped me either, and the problem isn't having the right therapist; it's me. My experience with therapy has been traumatizing and retriggering for many of my issues and has even prevented me from working through anything. The only way I can tolerate life without totally freaking out is by defaulting back to my unhealthy defense mechanisms.\n\nA big part of my PTSD symptoms is that I don't like to get close to people. I maintain my relationships just enough to pretend I can handle them. However, I'm totally withdrawn from them. I find myself saying, \"That friend is closer to me than I am to them,\" with most (probably all) of my friends. I struggle with making and maintaining intimate relationships, and I withdraw from all my friends and family constantly. I've never been in a nontoxic romantic relationship. I don't want to ice my friends out of my life. I crave connection and intimacy constantly. Declining myself from having connections is the only way I can survive. I shove myself into my career (I'm a high school band director) as a distraction from my problems because when I'm busy with work, I'm able to tell myself, \"I can't think about that right now, my students need me to focus on this\" but all that does is perpetuate my anxiety and make it worse. I believe that in education, my value is what I can give. The problem is that I can only give what I have, and I don't have much left in me anymore, but I don't want to fail my students because teaching means a lot to me. I don't want to give that up because I can't care for myself.\n\nI'm not happy. I am incredibly lonely and apathetic towards life. Advice is welcome, but mostly, I'm trying to see if anyone else is struggling with finding what they need to do, not just survive the day but find enjoyment. I don't think I'm out of luck and never find a way to enjoy life. I wish someone else could manage my life because I no longer have the energy to do so. The problem is not my mindset. I won't give up on myself, but I want to so badly. I won't because that's never who I've been, and I know therapy is beneficial and crucial for me in my life. Still, it would be so much easier to continue living unhappily than it is to find happiness, even though I know it's worth it; I've seen so many of my students go from being where I am to thriving because of proper support. \n\nMy educator comes out in me with this because I think giving up is the worst thing I can do for my mental health, but being retraumatized over and over again also isn't great. I know I have a support system around me if I ever choose to engage with it, but I've never been able to without finding out that my rock bottom goes deeper than I thought. That being said, if anyone who reads this remotely relates to the struggle of finding the right help, don't give up. I won't give up, and this post doesn't declare that. Failure is a symptom of growth and committing to success. I hope that if you relate to this in any way, there is solace in knowing that even if help is available, finding out how to advocate for yourself stinks. Sometimes, things are allowed to suck because, hopefully, it won't suck forever.",

    "selftext": "’m 17, living in India with supportive parents who’ve guided me in relationships, though sometimes a bit overbearingly. In 2021, my life changed when I joined Discord and met her. At first, it was purely platonic. She was dating someone else but struggling with deep emotional scars from a rough childhood. I wanted to help her, not expecting to fall in love. She began venting to me, and I became her emotional anchor. I suppressed my feelings, focusing on her well-being.\n\nOver time, things shifted. She started calling me “Dad,” and I assumed a protective role. After years of being her support system, she confessed feelings for me, though she later seemed to regret it. She developed an obsession with someone else, crossing boundaries and dismissing my pain. Despite this, I held onto the idea that “this isn’t who she really is” and kept forgiving her, believing I could help her heal.\n\nWe developed a codependent relationship. I even made an unhealthy self-harm pact to prevent her from hurting herself. Though I later addressed it, the damage was done, and it reflected how desperate and broken our bond had become. I gave up my self-respect to meet her emotional needs, and our dynamic became toxic. I avoided standing up for myself, convincing myself I had to save her.\n\nIn 2024, after rekindling our romantic relationship, the unresolved pain from our past persisted. I fought everyone—including my parents, who disapproved due to religious differences—to be with her. But the relationship became cyclical: I craved her love, and conflicts often ended with her giving in or me feeling terrible. She often feared I’d leave, and I constantly reassured her. Eventually, she said she needed a break, but we never fully took one.\n\nLater, she revealed feeling traumatized by some aspects of our relationship, which devastated me. I never intended to hurt her. She cheated on me in November 2024 and admitted it, but it shattered my trust. Around the same time, I lost my grandmother. Instead of being there for me, she ended the relationship, leaving me to grieve alone.\n\nNow, I struggle with a deep fear of abandonment and tying my self-worth to how others treat me. She told me our relationship was “unfruitful” and that she didn’t need my love. She compared me to a chatbot, claiming it helped her more than I did in three years. Her words cut deeply, and I feel like I failed her, though I know I genuinely loved her and tried my best.",

    "selftext": "I could really use some advice regarding my avoidant attachment and whatever else I have going on. So, I (18f) just started college this year and I just started my second semester and I've been having a ton of trouble dealing with loneliness and making friends which I kind of predicted.\n\nFor context, I grew up in an emotionally absent household with a single mother, who was very depressed and would take her anger (think screaming, yelling, and throwing things) out on my younger sister (who we’ll call Lia) and I. Some of the common insults were selfish, lazy, and stupid. we would also get the silent treatment often. She’d get angry if my sister or I started to cry and would tell us to stop crying. Basically, Lia and I were never allowed to feel upset, while my mom did– I didn't cry for years\n\nI became more insecure and anxious when covid hit. My sister's mental health took a bad turn, and I had to become more of a mediator than I already was. I listened to my sister's rants and vents about what she was going through while also dealing with interrogations from my mom about what my sister was doing, and her vents about her own issues. I would console my mom a lot. I always mediated between both, making sure neither's mental health was too bad and that they didn’t fight too much.\n\nI became somewhat of a “class clown” for my family so that they wouldn't be constantly fighting or upset. My mom still used insults like stupid, or lazy, or selfish adding loud and obnoxious as well. \n\nBecause of all this I've always felt like something was wrong with me, because other people around me seemed like they could connect with people so easily on a deeper level that I couldn't reach\n\nI’ve honestly always had this feeling deep down, that I was meant to be alone, that I always will be alone– the earliest memory of this being in fourth grade. This has been proven right so far since I've never been in a relationship or anything close to one either. I did have a friend group, but they would often tell me that they didn't really know much about me. I had one friend named Maya who reached out to me first in 2nd grade, and we stuck together until we joined a friend group in 6th grade. I never texted or hung out with anyone individually except for Maya. I don't really know why but I always felt lonely even though I kind of excluded myself.\n\nWhen I finally did get a phone and was able to text, every summer I ended up ghosting all of my friends because it felt too stressful to be talking all the time. I never considered the fact that people would be bothered by it. I didn't think people wanted to talk to me so badly. I ignored my friend’s text messages for days and would cancel plans last minute. I don't know why– it was never my intention to hurt people. I didn't think people wanted to talk to me so badly.\n\nI had lots of surface level friends in high school because they were mutual friends of people I knew. I always had a bit of anxiety in high school, but it dulled over the years.\n\n But now I'm anxious again. I have to be pretty, or else people won't approach me. I can't tell people my interests or be seen with certain people because I don't want them to think I'm weird. I hate being perceived but I also crave attention. Pls help. How can I become better?\n\nI'll probs post this in a couple other places as well because I really need advice, or just interpretations positive/negative. Let me hear it please.",

My family made a lot of sacrifices for me to be here. Things are not great back home (and not getting better either) and some times it seems like I'm the only part of my family's life that's going well. I keep a happy face when I'm talking to them, but truth is I'm deeply depressed, I struggle with survivor guilt everyday, and I have a lot of anxieties.\n\nI've become very lonely. Since moving here I've lost the person I thought was \"the one\" and most of my friends. I've tried socializing and finding new social groups again, but it's not easy and I'm not doing great on that front. It seems very possible to me that I'll live my whole life without anyone really close to share it with. \n\nOn top of all of that, my roommate recently screwed me over by leaving without enough notice. I haven't been able to find any new roommates or another place I can afford, and all my savings are gone. \n\nSo tonight it just dawned on me: I don't want children, I can see a possibility that I'll spend my own life lonely and miserable, and it's not like I'm having a good life rn. So the only reason I'm going through with all of this is just not to break my parents heart. That's the only thing keeping me going.\n\nI don't know how to end this point, I just needed to tell all of these to people I didn't know. If you read it, thanks!",

    "selftext": "I’m 15 now, and I’ve only recently started to realize that my family dynamic isn’t normal. My dad has autism, and while that has its own challenges, my mom and sister have been emotionally and psychologically abusive, and they both display narcissistic behaviors that have deeply impacted me.\n\nGrowing up, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD, but my mom hid that from me. She told me we didn’t have mental health issues and repeatedly reinforced the idea that my struggles were my fault. I’ve learned that a lot of my memories are blocked out, especially from ages 7 to 14, which I suspect is due to the emotional abuse I endured. It’s as if my brain erased those years as a coping mechanism because of the intensity of the trauma I experienced.\n\nI have vague memories of before I was 7, but after that, everything becomes a blur, likely due to the abusive environment at home. I struggled with things like bedwetting until I was 13, and during that time, my mom would beat me when she cleaned me up in the shower. There was no emotional support—only criticism and constant reminders that I was \"weak\" and \"undisciplined.\"\n\nMy mom, sister, and dad all reinforced this negative narrative, making me believe that everything was my fault. Their toxic behavior contributed to the development of severe anxiety, depression, and CPTSD. I also developed issues with socializing and learned to navigate relationships in dysfunctional ways due to their damaging advice.\n\nThe verbal abuse and emotional neglect broke me down to the point where I felt utterly hopeless. I performed well academically—scoring at 135 IQ—but despite this, I couldn’t thrive because my environment was so unhealthy. I genuinely believe that if I had supportive, understanding parents, I would have been capable of so much more.\n\nNow, I struggle with trust. I can’t seem to trust anyone—not even my closest friends—and I find it nearly impossible to feel love. I don’t even know what love feels like anymore. It’s like a concept that’s too far removed from me.\n\nThe hardest part of all this is my sister. She was a major factor in causing the depression I’ve gone through. Her behavior pushed me into three severe depressive episodes, and her constant criticism has contributed to my extreme social awkwardness. I feel completely broken, unsure of how to move forward.",

    "selftext": "Note: This is a very personal experience that may not relate to or work for everyone. I do not recommend using weed after experiencing psychosis, as it can potentially trigger deeper mental health issues. I made the decision to do this under the guidance and provision of a professional psychiatrist, and I strongly advise anyone dealing with similar issues to consult a mental health professional before considering anything like this.\n\n\nA couple of years ago, weed completely turned my life upside down. I smoked one day, like I’d done before, but this time was different. It sent me into a full-blown psychosis. I lost touch with reality. While I was in that state, I got into an accident—I hit my face, ended up with a concussion, and my whole world just fell apart.\n\nIt felt like my life was ruined. I couldn’t process what had happened to me, and I fell into this deep, dark place. For two years, I carried that trauma around like a weight I couldn’t shake. I avoided weed completely, avoided even thinking about it, because I blamed it for everything.\n\nBut after two years of running from it, I decided I couldn’t live in fear anymore. I wanted to face it. So, I did the one thing that scared me the most—I smoked again.\n\nAnd honestly, it was terrifying at first. But something else happened too. It was like this… awakening. All the emotions I’d been trying to push down—fear, anxiety, guilt, everything—they came rushing back, but in a way I’d never felt before.\n\nWhen you’re high, emotions don’t just feel stronger—they feel different. Anxiety, for example, came back to me like an old enemy I hadn’t seen in years. But this time, it wasn’t just the anxiety I knew—it felt new, like I was seeing it from a completely different perspective. It hit me in two ways: one part was the familiar fear I’d always had, the part I’d grown desensitized to. But the other part was this new, twisted version of it that weed brought out.\n\nIt felt horrible, like I was being forced to sit with my worst feelings with no way out. But at the same time, it was… healing. I started seeing my fears in ways I never had before. They almost felt like they were wearing different masks, showing me new sides of themselves. It was scary because it felt so raw, but it also made me realize something: these fears didn’t own me. I’d been running from them for so long, and now I was finally facing them.\n\nThat moment changed everything for me. It made me see that fear and anxiety aren’t just things to avoid. They’re part of you. And sometimes, the only way to deal with them is to stop running and actually sit with them—even when it’s messy and painful.\n\nWeed gave me psychosis two years ago. It almost destroyed my life. But it also gave me this awakening. It made me face myself in ways I never thought I could, and honestly, I came out stronger because of it.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been living alone for about 3.5 years now. I moved into a house that’s meant for a family of 4 or 5 people, but since it’s just me, a lot of the space is empty. At the beginning, I bought the necessities—mostly for the kitchen, which is the only part of the house that feels complete. My bedroom and office only have the basics, and I don’t even have a living room or dining room set up.\n\nFor a while, I thought about furnishing the place properly. Back when I was with my girlfriend, I felt motivated to buy furniture and make the house feel more like a home. But after we broke up, that desire just disappeared. Now, I rarely think about it, and when I do, it feels... complicated.\n\nSometimes, I think, “Maybe I should get some cool things for myself.” For example, I’ve been wanting to replace my plastic desk with a nice wooden one. But every time I consider buying something, it feels like I’m committing to some kind of emotional attachment. It’s like once I buy something, it stops being just a functional item and starts representing something bigger—like permanence.\n\nIt makes me feel like I’m locking myself into this place, even though I know I could always move. Maybe it’s because I’ve always had this idea of moving to another country. But even if I did, I feel like I’d face the same problem: I’d hesitate to buy things because of this fear of feeling attached or unable to move freely.\n\nAt the same time, I have this deep desire for a home—a cozy, peaceful place where I feel at ease. I know I deserve that, but I just don’t know how to make it happen.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this? I’d love to hear if others have struggled with these feelings around buying things and attachment. How did you work through it?",

Maybe I'm lucky and there are also specialized people around.\n\nI'll try to make a summary as short as possible:\n\nMy grandmother is 78 years old, I had and have a very close relationship with her, even now that I'm at my own house in another city.\n\nEverything was super ok, normal. For some time, more precisely for half a year, she started to have some changes in behavior that seriously worry me. At first, she started to forget a name or a date from time to time.. as we all do, I didn't give it much importance. Then she started calling me to tell me that she couldn't find x or y documents in the house. Then, she started accusing my father (who lives with her, there are only the 2 of them) that he stole them to hurt her. My father has never stolen anything in his life, he has other flaws like bad language or being angry all the time, but he has never stolen anything. To rule out anything, I installed cameras in the apartment and watched to see what was happening…I actually saw my grandmother hiding things like important documents and money in strange places and then telling me that my father stole them. When I told her that she was actually hiding them, she approved and said that she was doing it because she was suddenly “very afraid of my father”. Even if she admits this today, tomorrow she calls me and tells me again that my father stole, and this has been repeated every day for months. Recently she started barricading the door to the room where she sleeps at night with chairs and objects for fear that my father would come in on her, which is absurd.\n\nThe thing that worries me the most is that she calls me to tell me something… and a few hours later she calls me again to tell me the exact same thing we just talked about…\n\nFor months I've been trying to reassure her that everything is ok and normal as it always has been, that since we put cameras in place I haven't seen anything she says at all..but every time she tells me that “no, its happening and I’m plotting with my dad against her”\n\nHer sleep schedule has also changed a lot, meaning that she sleeps every 2 hours at night, in shifts, and wakes up at like 4 in the morning…\n\nI've already made an appointment at a good psychiatric clinic..but until then I'm asking for your advice if you can help me, if anyone has faced a similar situation..what can I do or what can I say to her? It breaks my heart when I hear it and I know that she's not really like that..\n\nThank you very much",

    "selftext": "I am experiencing an almost uncontrolled anger. It is mostly work, but I think it is because I spend most of the time in this specific social circle.\n\nImportant to note that my work isn't even that stressful and the pay & schedule are pretty reasonable. I know it is all me.\n\nPlease help with an advice where to start before it gets worse. This thing started affecting my personal life, and my spouse is noticing and saying that I need to get treated ASAP, but I don't trust therapists, etc. They all seem scammy to me.\n\nHere is a detailed description of what I feel and what it looks like:\n\n1. Constantly overthinking things, situations and conversations (especially with colleagues/bosses at work)\n2. Having random angry moments at home after work and even during weekends (Jumping around, running from one part of the house to another, making up random conversations with myself, fighting invisible enemies).\n3. Around 90% of all those angry moments are related to work and and people that are there even though I have a full understanding that I will meet people that I don't genuinely like pretty much anywhere so \"just change your job\" is not the answer here.\n4. Making up hypothetical violent scenarios in my head. For example, there is a colleague at work that doesn't like me too much, and I imagine this person becoming my boss soon, mistreating me and making my life living hell, and that makes me experience things in **the point number 2** \\+ more\n5. I take almost everything very personally even the things that don't happen to me at all, and project them on myself. Always imagining the worst outcomes possible for me.\n6. Often feel that there is a conspiracy against me at work, and people try to f\\*ck me up in the extremely passive aggressive scenarios. As if there is a plot to make me feel bad.\n7. Thinking about what if I did all of those crazy things in public/at work and that how it would ruin my life, and I would lose everything and become a crazy homeless dude. This adds more anger and makes me feel as if I am stuck in the cage and should show 0 emotion.\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.",

The thing is, whilst I've lost a lot of weight (>!2 stone in 2.5 months!<), I'm right on the edge of underweight, but I'm not underweight, and given the DSM criteria it worries me I wouldn't be listened to or treated with actual concern, but like I say, the people around me think it's really serious with how little I've been eating, how I've been feeling, the constant coldness, my slight social withdrawal and how it's impacted my mobility.

Such life lessons include: how to treat a woman (not by telling me to respect and treat them with kindness like everyone else, but by telling me how women behave and what the like, very misogynistic of him) , that I'm selfish because I don't consider buying a croissant for one of my colleagues, that I have to drink alcohol to live a good college life and that he hopes I don't regret it just because I don't drink etc.\n\nEvery time I talked back to him, he told me that at least he has friends. I am a very introverted person and have never had any friends up to this point. He thinks having friends makes him right.\n\nThese thoughts effectively destroyed my morale for the entire day. My mom called me asking me to help her carry the groceries she bought from the supermarket to our apartment. I was very irritated at that point. I heavily sighed and told her I'd come down.

    "title": "14M-Do these signs represent ADHD and should I tell my parents about this?",
    "selftext": "So I am a 14yo boy, and I fear that I might have adhd. I recently found out that some things that I do aren't quite normal and wanted to see if my worries are true or not.\n\n1.I am pretty lazy when it comes to school, I have great grades and all but I can never seem to get hw done because I find something else to do, even when I am motivated to do it I just get lost and most of the time I don't even start it(writing this while doing hw btw)\n\n[2.It](http://2.it/) feels like I am on auto-pilot: I've had this thing my entire life where I just go into deep thinking about scenarios(conversations with people, doing something etc) and after I stop thinking for like 1 second I find myself in a random spot doing something random with no clue how I got there. Ex: happend to find myself in the bathroom with a plate or my glass and idk why, after I get dressed I undress for no reason because I don't realise what I'm doing, walking around my house thinking and then after I snap out of it am confused on why Im even there.\n\n3. Forgetting stuff: My memory when it comes to studying or stuff like that is great, actually better than average pretty sure, but then there's also the other part. I forget multiple times a day where I have put stuff such as my phone and end up finding them in the most random spots that I don't remember putting them in. If you tell me to do something I will most likely forget in the next 2 seconds, and it annoys everybody(for reason). Some examples:  \nI went to the store, bought what I wanted but then forgot it on the counter(happend multiple times, though most of the time the cashiers reminded me to take them)  \nMy mom tells me \"Can you please get me (...) from the other room\", I say yes but by the time I get there I forget to do what she told me and start doing someting else.\n\n4. About hyper-activity: I am pretty much always fidgeting and/or playing with something in my hands, when I talk on the phone I always walk around the entire house during the entire call, when I am seated I start moving my legs, but overall nothing too bad.\n\n5.I am burnt out most of the time.\n\n6.I kinda feels like my mind is racing but not that bad, I am going to explain it:  \n  \nFor my entire life I have always been thinking, no matter how hard I try I can never stop it, I usually hear my voice and a song/backround sound the entire time, my thoughts are usually interupted and switched with others, when I was little I remeber having big trouble sleeping because of this, could never get my mind to calm down, now though I am tired when going to sleep so after like 10-15 I can stop it and fall asleep.\n\n7. I feel different from other kids, never really fit in. I am seen as weird and as a nerd,\n\n8.I phase out and as my parents say \"am in my own world\", witch is true, a lot of the time when watching TV, listening to them, to a video, in class I lose focus and start thinking about random stuff.\n\nAre these nothing to worry about or should I tell my parents to get checked out, I fear that they might say that I am faking it.

I'll be okay for a while but then I fall back into being unable to sleep, having no appetite, not being able to take care of myself or my surroundings to the extent I'd like to. \n\nEmotionally I don't really feel sad all the time anymore. I get sad sometimes when I start remembering the past or when I worry about the future and such but aside from that I'm generally fine so I don't really understand why I'm stull struggling so much.\n\nThings are generally pretty good right now in terms of my work/living situation but I still spend most of my free time rotting in bed. There's so many things I want or need to do but I can't seem to bring myself to do them. Once in a while I'll have sudden motivation to do a deep clean and take care of myself and such for a day or so, and I tell myself that from then on it'll be fine and I'll start being consistent with it, but then I wake up in the morning and all of that motivation is gone. The only thing that somewhat seems to help me do basic shit sometimes is a lot of caffiene, and that's hit or miss. \n\nI've tried several different medications and reacted very negatively to almost all of them. What I went through with the most recent medication has turned me off of them entirely unless they're strictly short term in an emergency. Was in therapy most of my childhood and teen years but I kept getting referred to different people after a while because they didn't know how to help. I don't understand why I am this way and I also don't really know how to fix it either. I've had someone suggest electro shock therapy and I'm considering looking into that. I'm also curious about ketamine therapy. I'm at the point of just trying random shit and seeing if anything works. I'm very physically active due to my job but that doesn't seem to make enough of a difference. \n\nIs there anyone out there that has been in a similar situation and has found success with alternative treatments? Even something like just taking a supplement or getting more of a certain vitamin, literally anything. I'm grasping at straws over here. Thank you for any advice y'all can give.\n",

    "title": "Celebrity's passing is affecting my mental health.",
    "selftext": "Or, rather, I should say my reaction to his passing because of my OCD problems is affecting my mental health.  The celeb is David Lynch, and I'm one of his many fans; he's my favorite filmmaker and has been since I was a young teen over 30 years ago.  He is how I got into liking movies in a more serious way.  However, having had various OCD issues for decades, one theme of which involves how I watch movies and TV, I have woven him into my OCD rituals as sort of my \"home base\" in terms of those rituals about movies.  \n\nMany people who have been fans for years are down.  Aside from being down just about his passing, I have a ritual or practice that I do for all directors whose movies I'm watching at a particular time.  I won't go into details because describing the ins and outs of one's OCD rituals isn't relatable.  It involves being in the \"space\" for whatever director I'm focusing on, and I sometimes return to Lynch in between others.  My problem is that I wasn't in his space when he passed, meaning in my warped view that my relation to his work is somehow compromised.  I was intending to do a deep dive back into his work while he was still alive.  I knew he wasn't well, but put it off.  I have a lot of discs (new BD editions; I've viewed the films) from him that I haven't watched or listened to because of other OCD and procrastination issues, and my enthusiasm for that is low.  Yesterday I went to my first movie since last week and, aside from the movie being not very good, I was just not into watching any movie at the moment.  Because of the nature of how I do things with my OCD, this is affecting other stuff outside of movies, too.  \n\nI'm trying to reason myself out of this, telling myself that I couldn't do anything about the ritual/practice not being correct (though I had been intending to get back into his \"space\" on the day he passed, but went to a movie that I had tried to go to the day before but was prevented from due to weather).  It's been difficult getting out of this funk after a week.  I'm attempting to look at the reality of the situation and break this thought trap.  It's weird that I did not have this reaction when two of my other favorite directors, Wes Craven and George Romero, passed - not even close.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to write that out.

I have to present a museum and I did actually visit it and take pictures (on the very last day I was still in that city of course).

I have taken the whole day today free in an attempt to put together at least a somewhat decent last-ditch Frankenstein presentation. But I just got so paralyzed throughout the entire day and always ended up doing something completely else. Even now, I'm writing this text instead of working on the slides.\n\nThis was such an easy course no less.

I am stuck in this limbo, still wanting to pull through somehow and hold it tomorrow, even if the presentation won't turn out good and I will feel bad and ashamed while others present. But for the sake of the credits and the own promises I made myself, I'd be willing to pull through that shame, and I don't want to give up on this when there's still a chance.\n\nAt the same time, I'd also just feel okay with it and accept it if I decided to give up on this now. Even if it is only hours before the deadline. I'm just so tired of everything. These past days I constantly kept fretting about how I'm gonna deal with this problem, I couldn't truly enjoy anything I was doing because I kept telling myself I had to sit down for once and finally work on this damn thing.\n\nNow I just don't feel anything anymore, or rather both outcomes feel tiring and somewhat scary. Just one day of sitting through a bad presentation is probably better than regretting not doing anything for the next few weeks, but right now I just really feel like doing nothing at all. I just want to have a peace of mind for once. I just want to do the things I like without getting anxious over other stuff for once.\n\nI don't know if anyone on here will be able to give any advice, but still thank you for reading through this if you did.

Recently, when I did a recitation at our class, I experienced some unexpected body tremors and that made me really uncomfortable while delivering my statement to our professor. I believe that the reason for this is because of my cigarette smoking that conflicts with the effectiveness of venlafaxine. I had public speaking fears on the past, but that was gone way before I began taking 75mg venlafaxine + 15mg mirtazapine last october. I can consistently deliver my statements then without having to fear of people even though I often experience making mistakes on my speech. Thus, I do not believe that it was the reason for those tremors. I am a type of person who puts their mind over their heart, and I had a set of beliefs and ideologies that I put into practice that counteracts any kind of emotional attacks. Something that I combine with antidepressants. I often experience tremors when   I smoke (which I did not give a shit until recently). This makes me deduce that my nicotine addiction is the primary suspect for my case.\n\nThis situation that I've experienced felt like something that I cannot comprehend with my knowledge. This is why I need some advices and insights regarding my situation. For more details regarding myself, I smoke 4 times a day and I am tapering off my nicotine addiction currently. I haven't taken exercises for months. I had tapered down my venlafaxine dose down to 37.5mg 2 weeks ago. Maybe not related, but I do not experience brain fog at all. I also have to add that I did self medication and I TAMPERED with prescriptions to get those antidepressants.\n\nAre my insights regarding my situation 100% accurate? Are the details I provided enough to deduce a solution? Is smoking the only reason I am experiencing these tremors?\n\nI hope that experts from this sub would provide enlightenment 🙏 \n\n",

Being horizontal lets fluid pool in my lungs far more easily, so I've been having very restless nights. \n\nI know many people have far worse/more chronic health conditions than this, but this has been horrible and has affected my life and mental health in the following ways:\n\n\\- My appetite is so strongly suppressed that I can barely eat. I can manage maybe 1000 calories per day. Currently I'm staring at a BAGEL I've been trying to shove down my throat for the past 90 minutes. I have been losing weight rapidly. Weight I've worked very hard to put on as a bodybuilder. Months of effort in the gym are going down the drain because of this. I can feel myself wasting away.\n\n\\- Work has been rapidly piling up. I have a heavy semester (4 courses plus an internship) and have been falling behind on challenging material because of my inability to go to class. My capstone project supervisor just sent me a lengthy message telling me he's gravely concerned about the level of progress on my project. The same guy is the boss at my internship and I feel like I'm making a rough first impression due to this slow start. He's very smart and experienced in my industry and I feel he would make a fantastic mentor if I could impress him, but as it stands I am falling further and further behind. At home, dishes are piling up. My house is slipping further into disarray. It feels like everything is falling apart.\n\n\\- I legitimately feel like a shell of myself. I feel like all this high fever and intense coughing has killed brain cells. I feel like I can't think or process information like I normally can. And I'm so volatile. It's so easy for me to get set off and irrationally angry about small things at the moment. Mainly WHY am I STILL SICK. It's been a WEEK for god's sake. WHEN WILL I EVER BE OK AGAIN?\n\nI know that worrying about all these things I can't control is not conducive to my recovery. I know that stressing like this is pointless and I should just focus on getting better. But it's REALLY HARD to do that. The world does not pause for you when you're sick. So many things that are so important to me are in jeopardy right now. Even once I get better, I have no idea how I'm going to pick up all these pieces. I wanted to do well this semester. This was not something I could afford to have happen. I feel so lost and out of control.",

    "title": "Struggling with Emotional Attachment How Do I Protect My Mental Health Without Losing a Friend ?",
    "selftext": "\nI’m a 20M, and about 10 months ago, I started regularly talking with my only female friend. At first, it felt amazing—we’d talk for hours, mostly at night. She opened up about her life, struggles, and so much more, which made me feel like we had a strong connection.\n\nOver time, though, a pattern started forming: she’d call me for a few nights in a row, and then go completely distant for weeks or even a month. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but the things she shared and the bond we seemed to have built made me feel emotionally attached to her, maybe even in love.\n\nWe’re college friends, but since I rarely go to college, we don’t interact much in person. When we do, she’s usually busy with her other friends, and all we exchange is a quick “hi” or “hello.” It’s during those late-night calls where I’ve always felt the closest to her.\n\nRecently, though, she’s barely shared anything with me. When I ask about it, she says she’s focused on her future and doesn’t want to take on unnecessary stress. I understand that, but the way she distances herself for days or weeks and then suddenly comes back really messes with me emotionally.\n\nWhen I try to call her, she rarely picks up, and if she does, her replies are cold or dismissive. Once, she even told me she’d block me, which hurt a lot. I said I’d block her too, and her response was, “Block me if you can,” like she knows how attached I am to her.\n\nLately, things have gotten even harder. I’ve started seeing her in my dreams, and it’s like she’s always on my mind, even when I’m asleep. Sometimes, I wake up feeling choked, like I can’t breathe, and these feelings of being overwhelmed have made me question if I even want to keep living my life. It’s a scary and isolating place to be in, and I don’t know how to get out of it.\n\nEvery time she does call, I promise myself to keep it casual and act like a normal friend, but the moment I hear her voice, all my emotions come flooding back. I’m mentally and emotionally exhausted from this cycle. I don’t want to block or ghost her because I genuinely value our friendship, but I also can’t keep going like this.\n\nHow do I detach emotionally without losing the connection entirely? Any advice would really help.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I'm so sick and tired of seeing couples on social media, or even any romantic/sexual posts on media, it's like mockery to me, my own phone is saying: \"Instead of scrolling, go outside loser.\". And very tired of listening to male classmates talk about having gfs, even the worst a'hole of the class talks about girls, but not me, not at all.\n\nA bit of blame can be put on me though, as i'm very isolated and live a very robotic life. Home -> High School -> Home , with sometimes, going out in the city with \\*\\*my parents\\*\\* cause i am way too ashamed of myself to go alone. I'm very shy and quiet, and was often bullied for even speaking, my voice is pretty deep but weird sounding, and because of bullying, not only for my voice, i just try to be as reserved as possible. So, my chances of getting a gf while being a complete fallout shelter typa guy, is close to if not 0.\n\nBut the thing is, my depression sometimes makes me think i am as ugly as a man can be, and insecurities about myself run across my mind like wild fire, but when my mood is a bit up, i don't think i look as bad, and honestly, i might not be ugly that much, i do reckon getting looked at by random girls, even a couple days ago, i was walking with a hood over my head, pretty much amplifying my face, and a girl walking by me was staring for seconds before passing by, that gave a little boost to my hope of getting a gf, but not enough to try really.\n\nSo in short, i'm not that bad looking, probably 6/10, potentially 7.5/10 if i had the will to work on myself, but i'm very shy, quiet, very isolated, paranoid perhaps, or all detail in short, i'm a loser pretty much all the time. \\*Is there any hope i will be able to have a gf one day?\\*",

I also learned it's important to ask help or other opinions from other people. \n\nI'm a musician and love playing and doing gigs! In 2021 I quitted a band that I formed because we hadn't performed in two years. I did bring up the issue, but we didn't see eye to eye on that. For them it was more about making music and being together, they told me. I was kind of angry because they did cancel rehearsals two hours before we'd start. They too we're angry. We did kind off talk it out, but still I was angry and upset: I did put in a lot of effort in that band and then it all vanished because people were becoming lazy.\nI left the band and continued my own way. \nIn the meantime I found other projects and did a lot of gigs in the meantime. \nBack in 2023, a friend of mine, got in the band I quitted in 2021. Unfortunately, he was acting like: 'they thought you were pushing them around'. Luckily, during therapy I learned how to stand up for myself. I told him it's irrelevant for me if people gossip about me. I don't need to know, everyone has the right to gossip. I also told him that he needs to stop saying things like that, he told me this a couple of times.\nNow we are in 2025. The band didn't have any gigs yet, but somehow I still feel some anger and a childish sense of jealousy. \nSince 2021 I had over 20 gigs and currently I'm playing in a very fun band. Yet, the thought that one day they might actually perform just makes me afraid... I HATE myself for being so childishly jealous, this isn't at all like me!\n\nI'm having a hard time figuring out on how to cope with this. Note: I haven't been struggling with this for 4 years. I also had moments I didn't think about this at all!\nCan you guys give me some nice advice?",

I find it nearly impossible to process information when I try to learn something new. No matter how hard I focus, I can't make sense of what I'm trying to understand. My mind fixates on a piece of information, turning it over and over,  but the more I think about it, the harder it becomes to grasp.\n\nFor example, I know what a car looks like and how it works, but if I try to process what a car really is, I can't fully understand it. It feels absurd, but even the simplest concepts can completely escape me. Strangely, when I think less about something, I sometimes have a better chance of understanding it. Yet, I know it's impossible to understand anything without thinking at least a little.\n\nThe older I get (I'm 22 now), the worse it becomes. Basic concepts that once made sense seem to slip away from me, and it’s like I'm losing the ability to comprehend even the fundamentals. This is especially challenging because I'm in university, where I'm expected to study advanced math. Over time, I forget everything I've learned—not just academic subjects, but even simple things, like what a car is or how to walk or blink.\n\nI think this issue might be connected to my ADHD.

So they took me off very quickly. \n\nNow I’m on another med, vyybrid? and it makes me just not care about my moves in life.  Like Wellbutrin made me not care, but that was a beautiful feeling because it felt more positive. This makes me not care in such a negative way. But I would rather feel THIS than what I was feeling 2 weeks ago which was overly emotional and I just didn’t want to leave my room. \n\nWhile also meeting with a therapist through all of this, she thinks I have PTSD and my body is just in fight or flight mode.

One of the most regular issues is that whenever someone asks me a question, like asking me what I want for dinner or something basic, I get a lump in my throat and I go speechless. Not speechless in a shocked way but I just can't seem to talk as I would feel very overwhelmed to the point of crying and I would try to go around the question by saying to go ask someone else. \n\nI also have a nonverbal issue. I have a common tendency to only mumble out answers or to only nod or shake my head. For example the other night I was eating some leftover in the kitchen as my mum and Jess, who is her best friend, come into the kitchen aswell and my mum starts to ask me how the food it an all that and I could only mange to look at her and nod my head. This obviously made my mum annoyed as she looked at Jess and said ' nonverbal again.', once she said that I couldn't help but just want to cry and pull my hair out. \n\nA few more small problems I have are having a disgust towards people who I live with and sensory issues. I have a older sister, 18, who lives with my mum and i. She is very chatty and friendly but I find everything she dies, even the way she smells, is absolutely horrid to me. I can't be close to her, or anyone infact, as I feel like I want cry and hypervent when I feel her skin on mine or us touching, her breath, the smell of her and basically everything. This is also the case with my mum as I can't stand giving her affection such as hugs and kisses as all I want to do is cry. \n\nAll I want to know is why do I do this and is there anything wrong with me?",

My course spans three years, divided into six semesters, and I’ve successfully completed three. However, I’m now at a standstill, struggling to move forward.\n\nMy family in Nepal used to support me financially with my semester fees. They are farmers, relying on crops, livestock, and the land for their livelihood. But a devastating flood struck our home country just a few months ago, leaving many, including my family, in ruins. Their income source has been wiped out. Their property destroyed. Their lives shattered. They are struggling to survive.\n\nNow, I find myself alone, overwhelmed with the weight of circumstances beyond my control. My semester fee is overdue, and I don’t know what to do. If I can’t pay it soon, my visa will be canceled, and I’ll be forced to leave Australia and abandon my education. We have already invested so much for me to be here. Returning home now, empty-handed, would destroy me—and my family.\n\nI’ve tried everything. I’ve reached out to organizations, explored loan options, and even contacted my university for assistance. But as an international student, I’m not eligible for any financial aid or loans. I can’t even take a break from my studies, as the rules for international students don’t allow it. I feel trapped in a system with no way out.\n\nMy family is in a dire situation, injured and hospitalized, and I cannot be with them. They’re willing to give me what little they have left, but it’s nowhere near enough. Every day feels heavier than the last. I’m drowning in despair, and I feel like I have no one to turn to.

    "selftext": "I'm 21 years old, female. When I was 16 (was about to turn 17 in a month) I was diagnosed with OCD, that was my first diagnosis.  I've started to see a psychotherapist in a month after I got that diagnosis from a psychiatrist and he told me the same. Ever since I was almost 14 I always thought I had bipolar disorder but I never self-diagnosed, yet I told everything I have been feeling since I was a child, to my doctor. He and many other doctors/psychologists in 4 years that I've kept seeing kept focusing on OCD but not other problems. They told me many times that it's possible that I may have bpd or ADHD and at last i was diagnosed with ADHD, dysthymia, and OCD. With my 'intellectualization' coping mechanism, I learned so much about psychology that at one point, whenever my friends or relatives would tell me any of their problem I would've start either diagnosing them or trying to help them like a therapist. Anyway, my OCD started when I moved from where I used to live for 11 years to another place in the same city. It started with me feeling like I'm not cleaning myself in the shower too good and I should do it in repeated numbers or in a pattern. Yet I was not showering each day. (By the way what I mean by showering is, cleaning each part of my body \"perfectly\") Then I went to another city for university and I started to shower each day, I would not talk to anyone until I brush my teeth. (Not even a sound) I stayed in a dorm on my first year, the first thing I do when I wake up would be straight up going to shower. Then in my sophomore year, I started to stay at my own house but my ocd also got progressive. I started to clean myself two times a day, sometimes 4-5 times. I could not have started anything at all without having a shower first. And today, I mean lately for about 2 years, I shower first thing in the morning and then wash myself again before going out. But there must be 2 hour during that 2 washing. I'm at a point where I feel like a miserable person. I tried anything I could to solve it, all my other problems had descended yet this one... How can you help me guys? \nJust saying: I had schema therapy, cbt, self-compassion therapy, and I have been doing meditation as constant as I am able to for almost 5 years now. ",

I am as aforementioned, single and desiring to mingle. Only 19, pretty stained in the brain, not very social but willing to put myself out there. I'm transfem but still present male for lack of either confidence or comfort. Let's move on to the main dish of this post.\n\nI have been single for ~3 years following my 9th(excluding stupid rebounds and spur ones) relationship that lasted just under 2 years. Wow that's a feat isn't it? Well, not really, considering she was only my girlfriend to feed information about my personal life to the wicked witch of the west. You'd understand if you read the other post I mentioned. I've been pursued 11 times in the last 3 years. I said no to each of them. Was I attracted to any of them, personality or otherwise? Yeah, I was, but even though I wanted to..... I simply couldn't get myself to accept. Whaaaat? Relationship drama trauma?? Anyways. I myself have pursued two people to date. One of them said that they're getting over another relationship and found it super sweet that I liked her. She has inconsistent online activity, but she messaged me again weeks later asking if I'm still willing. Well, I saw the message, and I really really wanted to, but something in me said \"Aw hell nah\" and deleted the app I was messging her through entirely before I ever replied. I still haven't spoken to her, and that was probably a but over a year ago. There's this other girl I pursued, LDR. She was very smart, very pretty, very understanding, and had the same interests as me. I literally mean the same interests. 3 months of talking abt it and I try to make it official, I get shot down but only bc she doesn't want LDR. I say that I'll move to where she is so it can be a thing and she agrees. Unfortunately, smth happened regarding her brother just days later and she deletes ALL social media accs and I haven't talked to her since, and it's been 7 months. I won't dive into the possibilities of her wellbeing, or even her being, because I don't want to thing about that. Rn I work at a restaurant, and I find a regular at this restaurant attractive, so I want to ask for her number. Every time I see her, I can't get the words out of my mouth.\n\nMy question: Wtf is wrong with me and how can I fix it, if possible? It's just trauma, right?",

My mind loops through worries, doubts, and fears, leaving me wide awake while the rest of the world sleeps. It’s a cycle that’s been destroying my sleep schedule, making it nearly impossible to function during the day.\n\nI find myself struggling with even the most basic daily tasks—getting out of bed, focusing on work, and maintaining relationships. Everything feels overwhelming, and the exhaustion only makes it worse. I know I need support, but it’s so hard to find. Professional help isn't readily available to me, and the lack of it leaves me feeling lost and alone.\n\nThe loneliness that comes with mental health struggles is one of the hardest parts. When you're up at 3 a.m. staring at the ceiling, feeling like you're the only person awake in the world, it's easy to spiral further into despair. I’ve tried self-help strategies, meditation, journaling—anything to take the edge off—but there are times when I just need a human connection, someone to remind me that I’m not alone in this.\n\nI hope that one day I can find a support system that fits my needs, whether it’s an app, a helpline, or a community where I can reach out at any hour.

He’s lost probably about 20kg of weight over the past 6-7 months and is very very skinny at the moment. Usually we do not live together but are on holiday together at the moment so I am able to observe his habits a lot more closely. We ordered pizza for dinner tonight, to share, however he only had a single piece and could not even finish that. This lead to me confronting him because he hasn’t eaten much else that day and I brought up how unhealthy it was and how concerned I am for his health. He then broke down and told me he’s been so depressed recently, he’s apparently miserable every second of every day, says he wants to s/h and the only thing stopping me is that he knows I would see it. We had a long conversation, I urged him to seek professional help and even said i’d pay for/attend his first session with him. The issue is that he can’t afford ongoing therapy at the moment, and I can’t afford to pay for ongoing therapy for him. He also refuses to take medication because of some bad experiences in the past. I have personally had very positive experiences with medication for my mental health so I tried to tell him to just give it another chance but he seems pretty set on his decision. I’m at a loss, I love him so much and want to help him but this is literally out of my capacity to help with, yet he won’t seek professional help. I really need advice because it’s destroying me seeing him like this. I plan to message his mum and best friend and loosely explain the situation/ask them to look out for him. Beyond that I feel useless though, I’ll take any advice I can get. Sorry for the long post, and sorry if it’s a big ramble, i’m not in the best state at the moment. ",

I hate seeing people; l hate everything. I'm always so unhappy and angry about everything. I've lost any kind of interest in life or living, and I have no desire to live past 25. I don't see a point in moving forward, but I'm too scared to even try to escape this life. I just don't have the courage. I feel so trapped, hopeless, and confused. I keep asking myself, What's the point of all of this? What is the point of living if life feels this hard and meaningless?",

I've been kind of thinking that because I'm a teenager, what I'm experincing is normal, but I'm just not wrapping my head around it completely for some reason.I don't have any motivation to do anything. I'm constantly cheating on my tests due to my dropping grades, my room is getting more and more cluttered and I feel myself distancing from my parents. I love them, I do. I often have silent panic attacks in public because of being too scared to be seen by strangers, or being too nervous to walk into grocery stores in fear of people looking at me, to the point of unwarrantedly yelling at my mom and begging her to let me stay in the car. I feel horrible about it every time, but it just comes out. My mom tells me that I'm just shy, and it'll pass. I want to talk about it to my parents about it maybe being something else, but I'm scared of how they'll react. My hygiene has been constantly spiraling down too. I'm too tired and unmotivated to brush my teeth or my hair, or to even shower sometimes. I'm homeschooled over online, because I was bullied at my old schools. I have no friends, and no people my age to be around, and I feel like I'm missing out, and that I have been missing out for years.\n\nSorry if this post is too long, feel free to tell me and I'll delete it or edit it.",

    "selftext": "TW eating disorder, self harm, \n\nBasically what the title says. I know I’m unwell, but due to past actions I have no idea how to move forward from them to help myself. My apologies if this isn’t coherent or just plain messy to read, im just trying to get it out at the moment.\n\nI’m a 16 year old girl that has diagnosed anxiety and suspected depression, but that’s honestly all. I went through a time in my life (late 2022- early 2023) where I was an extremely aggressive and sometimes violent person. I would often start arguments with my parents most days, and while looking back I’m not 100% sure why, I believe it to be partially because it was a way to get my emotions out. I know that isn’t an excuse for a child to act like that, but it’s the only reasoning I can find for why I acted that way. There were even times when they threatened to call the police on me, because of how I was acting, and looked into boarding schools so I would be away more, as to not tear the family apart. (Screaming at them during arguments at 10/11pm, multiple times a week)\n\nDuring this time in my life, I did self harm quite a bit, and often after these arguments. It wasn’t anything severe, but I would still hurt myself so I guess it still counts. My parents never found out about this. Not sure what happened after this time, but I found myself coming out of how I was acting after a few months, much to my parents relief. The last few years we would argue every so often, but it would be resolved pretty quickly. This brings us to now.\n\nWithin the last six months or so, I’ve started to get bad again. In July I almost got kicked out of the house by my father because I caught the bus home from school 2 and a half hours early, as I had a panic attack at school and he wouldn’t pick me up. When I got home (at about 1pm) he told me to ‘pack my shit’ because he was going to take me to the police station, and put me in resi care or something. It didn’t end up happening as my mum talked him out of it, but it was a lot at the time. Since then we’ve been arguing a lot more, and I can tell it’s getting bad again. My mental health has been deteriorating again this year and I’ve started self harming again. My eating has gotten worse and I’ve been essentially starving myself, only eating once a day usually, and small things. \n\nI know I need help, and I’ve tried to speak to my parents about it a few times but due to how I was in 2022, they’ve essentially ‘given up trying to help me’ because they tried for months back then, and I just never did anything with it. I know how I acted back then was terrible and I can’t fix it now, but I’m scared if I don’t get help that I’ll end up getting worse and worse. I just don’t know what to do because of how broken the relationship is with my parents.\n\nI can go into more detail about things if needed, I appreciate you taking the time to read about my issues.",

    "selftext": "Has anyone ever experienced something like this?\n\nA long time ago, I changed several habits of mine because of this issue, such as having lunch with my family, being touched by my girlfriend while I'm eating, having snacks with friends and, most recently, I started to skip lunch. Somehow, the issue ended up affecting even things that don't directly envolve affection or being touched. Just the thought of lunch being an activity known for bringing a family together is enough to make me feel sick. Any conception and construction I have about what love is, and how it can be expressed, is enough to mess up my life. With some people, it's even harder to control, especially because of the proximity we share, but mainly because of the trust issues. The first thought that comes to my mind is: \"if I ask this person to stop, will they respect my decision?\". I built a hierarchy of trust in my head, from the most complicated to the simplest to deal with: love interests, family, friends and strangers. The funny thing is, how come my mind thinks a stranger is more trustworthy than a partner?\n\nBecause of this idea, my psychologist suggested that I might have suffered some kind of abuse during childhood. Not necessarily sexual violence, but a \"simple\" psychological abuse while I was eating, which expands the range of hypotheses. For example, I may have heard someone swearing at me during lunch and it created a trauma. The bif issue is that I don't remember basically anything from my childhood, not even my traumas. These days, I've been having some trouble swallowing pills and dealing with strong emotions, always around food. I don't know what to do or what to think about it anymore, I just want to be free from this issue and go back to living normally.\n\nPlease, if you have any idea of why this is happening or if you have a suggestion that might help me, please, do.",

    "selftext": "\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two months now. Since I’ve known my boyfriend he’s struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. He’s always been more open and vulnerable with me than others, even when we were just friends. I’m the only person he tells about how he’s really doing. He doesn’t have a good relationship with his family, and they are a big reason why he struggles with his mental health. So he doesn’t really talk to them, especially not about his feelings. He does have a group of really close friends that he talks to all the time. They’re aware that he struggles with his mental health and has depression, but they don’t know the full extent or that he has suicidal thoughts. He also has a lot of things going on in his life at the moment that he’s really struggling with that they’re not aware of. When I ask why he doesn’t open up to them he always gives me the same excuse “we’re guys we don’t talk about those things”. But the times they have found out about something going on in his life, they’ve always supported him and helped him out. I think he just doesn’t think he deserves the support and rather deal with it alone, because that’s what he does to me whenever he’s having a bad episode and tries to push me away. His mental health has gotten worse as of recently and he self harmed for the first time a couple weeks ago. I don’t know if that’s true, but he swears it’s the first time and that he stopped immediately after the first cut. And just yesterday, he told me that he was close to hurting himself again, but this time with the intent to end it. I fear it’s gotten to be too much for me to handle alone and that he needs more help and support than what I can offer him. I still want to be here for him and I love him so much. But I just don’t know what to do. I’m considering telling his friends about it and letting them know the full extent of his mental health, but I’m worried he’ll get mad at me for telling them and try to push me away. The last thing I want is for him to further isolate himself. I also feel like it’s my only option because he doesn’t have the means to get professional help. Should I go ahead and tell his friends regardless if he gets upset about it?",

We went to the same university and we found out that we really liked each other and chose not to tell anyone for cultural reasons (homophobic family and that type of shit) also just the environment at our university. I graduated in May and she still has a year. She's obviously a full time student and athlete so I understand that she is probably busier than me, although I work and have been studying for graduate exams and have been pretty busy too. It started off really well, we spent a lot of time together and really enjoyed each others presence, even for small things. Over the summers we wouldn't see each other because of strict family and distance and so when summer ended I was always so excited for her to come back in town (i stay 25 mins from our university she lived at). Although we text throughout the day and call every night, it recently seemed too tedious to meet for her, so i see her only about once every week or every 2 weeks. it's short, usually just to eat and spend some time together. we aren't intimate anymore (which isn't really the biggest issue to us but still is a factor). i usually pay for everything when we go out. I spoil her all the time (i am just a gift giver). i also drive to her and drop her off every time. \ni know, it sounds crazy and i don't know why i didn't see these as major issues until i finally voiced how sad it all makes me that i feel unreciprocated. we have taken breaks and she's begged not to so we compromise. things get better for a little and just go straight back to the the distance. she has always told me she thinks something is wrong with her emotionally, and i just have personally never felt super emotional or needy of attention. but because i receive almost none from her, i feel crazy asking for it from her. she always apologizes when i tell her that but that's when i feel like it's all not her fault. \nshe's pretty spoiled by her parents and they stock her up with everything before semesters, visit her often and bring her stuff so she doesn't go out often, and she's naturally a homebody. they also\npay her so they will know if her spending is done on someone else and i know she's paranoid about that so i think that's why she doesn't pay for me. i am middle eastern so paying for friends is always the last thing i'd worry about. \nanyways, ive recently been trying to end things but im filled with guilt that she's just misunderstood and im being unfair. when i hear her say that she genuinely loves me it makes me feel so sad that i dont feel it, and how she admits she could be doing better and will try to. i just feel stuck, fed up, but i also love her. \n i've seen videos on anxious and avoidant attachment styles and I don't think i am the anxious style but I think she could possibly be the avoidant. if that's not the case, then it just has to be lack of love.

While this person never identified as atheist and neither do I (more so agnostic), I am not sure how to feel now that they are going back to conservative Christianity. I have seen it coming for some time now and felt uncomfortable but today while talking to them they revealed that they are “trying to get back to the path God has for them” when I mentioned something about sexuality. This person previously identified as gay and says they are not ex-gay but it’s complicated. Obviously this is a very sensitive and personal topic and these things can be fluid but I don’t think that is what’s happening here and it made me uncomfortable because I remember them coming out and the way they were treated by the rest of my family was a catalyst to me realizing how wrong my family was. Now it feels like things are completely flipped around. I am finding it harder and harder to reconcile Christianity with the kind and compassionate person I want to be and they are going back to how we were raised. I feel confused and a little betrayed although I know that is not fair. I’m left wondering if maybe I am the one who is wrong and we really do get conservative again as we get older. At one point I was the most devout person in my family and now all of my siblings are becoming more conservative while I am increasingly becoming more liberal and non religious. I feel really alone and it makes me feel like I am in the wrong. Has anyone experienced this? I don’t want to lose this relationship and I know it is their own business what they want to follow but it is very triggering for my religious trauma ",

    "selftext": "I was born in Egypt and spent half my life there. For the other half, I’ve been living in Canada. I have two loving parents who care for me deeply, but my mom has been critically ill since I was little, even to the point of near death. My dad was always focused on taking care of her, so I didn’t get to see them often. After school in Egypt, I’d stay at my grandparents’ house until my parents finished work at 8 p.m. They’d pick me up, we’d spend a couple of hours together, and then the cycle would repeat. I’m not complaining—I’m thankful, as things could have been worse.\n\nHowever, growing up without my parents around much meant I didn’t learn to study or work hard. Instead, I was pampered by my grandparents, which I think is where my first problem started. I can’t seem to focus or push myself to do much, especially with schoolwork. It’s not because I’m incapable, but I find it hard to apply myself.\n\nWhen we moved to Canada, we hoped things would improve, but my mom was diagnosed with the same illness again. She was sick for almost four years, one of which she spent in and out of the ICU. Moving here allowed me to spend more time with my parents, but their struggles made them fragile under stress. They snap easily, and while I don’t blame them, it’s hard to talk to them—especially my dad. He has a short temper, and we argue often, even though I love him deeply, and I know he loves me too.\n\nRight now, I’m in grade 12 and struggling to focus in school. I used to be a top student, but now I procrastinate constantly and compare myself to others. My room is always a mess, and I can’t bring myself to clean or do anything productive. I feel hopeless and don’t know how to motivate myself to study or work on anything important.\n\nAnother issue I’m dealing with is pornography and masturbation. I really want to quit. I’m close to my religion, which I deeply love, and I want to overcome this to better myself and prepare for my future wife. I was raised in the church, and it’s always been a part of my life, but this habit feels like it’s holding me back from living up to my values.\n\nSpeaking of my future wife, I met a girl about a year and a half ago, and I’ve fallen completely in love with her. I want to change so I can be the best version of myself for her. She’s the complete opposite of me—always studying, consistent at the gym, and pushing herself. I feel like I don’t deserve her because she’s everything I want to be. I know it must be exhausting for her to push me to improve, and I feel guilty for not meeting her efforts. I want to change for both her and myself, but I feel like it might be too late.\n\nOn top of all this, I’ve been slacking spiritually. My faith is very important to me and has been a part of my life since childhood, but I’ve neglected it recently. My church is where I met my friends and community, but I feel disconnected from it now.\n\nOverall, I really want to change, but I don’t know where to start. Even writing this has been difficult because I lack motivation, but I know I need to take this step for myself. I want to get rid of laziness and procrastination, pornography and become a better person. Please, I need help.",

It's all I have left of him. I even took a selfie with it. That's one thing that hurts a lot. Not having any photos with him or of him at all.

I used to think that it was because of social media so I got rid of everything except for reddit since I occasionally use it to find answers to obscure questions.\n\nFor a while this worked, and it made me more engaged with my hobbies and also resulted in me finding new things to do.

Nowadays however, I just don’t feel like studying or doing any hobbies.

Anyway my mind is so wrapped up with the dumbest things. Many thoughts I should not be entertaining. Was talking to a co-worker and trying to (with zero luck) take out. Did once learned I am bad at small talk. Inner idiot 1 - me 0. Entertain the funny idea of them talking to a buddy that they use to date years ago. (already seen it going bad but again I hate me) Long story short cause I am already thinking of deleting this. The co-worker takes me home but we are chatting it up in the car. Before I get out they are texting my buddy which is cool no ill will. They try to make it a joke to try and go out for dinner that night. They ask me to come as a type of security blanket. I agree cause I look at as good guy points. We all go to dinner. It was like watching a rom-com happen in front of me. (I hate me) Inner idiot laughing at me while I scream internally. Yes, yes I know i could of said something or told this person how i felt about them. I am an idiot i know but i also hate me. Anyway that is a long crap read. Sorry....\n\nFrom this experience I've learned this about me: \n\nI hate me\n\nI am horrible at talking to people\n\nI push people away by using dark humor and perverted comments\n\nAll relationships I've ever been in have been FWB then a relationship\n\nI am addicted to masturbation, (becoming harder cause of the meds are hindering \"arriving\")\n\nDrinking is coming back in to play with the other meds (I'm an idiot yes I know)\n\nwhy did i even type all this? cry for help? hoping to listen to others stay away from the voice in my head. 38(m) still stuck in the past of bury it bury all emotions you're a \"man\" oh well oh i am seeing p-sychologist and a therapist. so thats covered.

    "selftext": "I'll try to make this as simple as I can. \n\nSo 3 years ago I bought my first house, I may have jumped the gun buying the first house and not taking things around me in the consideration. The neighbors right next to my house had at least 30 dogs which bark all hours in the day, they considered themselves an operating kennel. Once my boyfriend moved in he was just as annoyed by it. You couldn't even go outside it was so terrible. When I mean every minute of the day I mean every minute of the day.  I either didn't want to be home or I would do everything I could to avoid being home. \n\nWe went through the channels with the dog warden and went to court and tried to fight against it, we lost. We decided it wasn't worth the hassle and sold the house. \n\nFast forward to this last April we moved into our new house. Our neighbors below us are a little younger than us and they have two dogs. Most of the time they are inside but sometimes they do let them outside. It's just two dogs and in all reality they probably don't bark anymore than anybody else's animals do. I can even see mine go outside on the porch at home when we are not home and they will bark too, at what who even knows. \n\nI feel like I am traumatized by my neighbor's dogs barking. Overall there well-behaved dogs, I have gone down to get the mail and they will let you pet them they are overly friendly just a little excited. There was a few occasions where they did come up here but they didn't cause any issues and once I said something to them they secured them. Things happen I get it. \n\nI feel like I'm taking out the last couple years of trauma hearing my previous neighbor's dogs on my current neighbors. In all reality something like this should not bother me as much as it does. Their dogs are no worse than my dogs. I said something to my neighbor one day and a fit of anger and she made a comment like ' look we both have our own ways of life that we live, we don't complain about your roosters crowing all hours of the day or your loud motorcycles or trucks. It's just how we can respect living next to each other '. She was 100% right. \n\nI don't know what to do I feel like this is debilitating me. It's like I hear them or see them and I'm instantly transported back to hearing 30 dogs howling and barking all at once and I have to hide inside my house. It constantly gives me intrusive thoughts, awful thoughts about what I can do to shut up the barking and it's nothing rational. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What is going on? My boyfriend now says this is a normal day-to-day life, it's not like it was at the old house but it's just so hard for me to get my mind out of the gutter. I feel like I tell myself if I didn't have to live through that this wouldn't bother me as much as it does, but I just don't know how to train myself elsewise. ",

After i started playing again my mental health started to get pretty bad though, since i knew that i lost 2.5 years of practice that i couldn’t get back and that i lost so much progress that i could’ve made in that time. I’ve always wanted to study music and i got thrown back into reality by playing again and noticing how much i missed in the time i couldn’t play.\n\nMy mom randomly ran into my former piano teacher in a shopping center and asked if she‘s still giving lessons, since i want to take lessons again. Unfortunately she is gonna be retiring soon so i can‘t have her as my teacher anymore but she said i should visit her at music school soon just to talk again. \n\nI talked her for a few minutes at music school today after my cello lesson and we were both really happy to get to talk again. After we talked for a bit i told her that i‘m doing a lot of exercises to get back into playing since i lost a lot of technique and i got that kind of weird feeling that she doesn‘t respect me as a musician anymore from the way she talked. I can‘t really explain it but she was always a person who had high expectations in me since i was learning really fast and was really passionate about playing and when i developed my chronic illness i could also notice that she was also brought down by it because i couldn‘t practice anymore. I also started playing cello and she was also really weird about that. I feel like she thinks i‘m just some wanna be musician who‘s just ass and really bad at their instrument. \n\nIk this also might just be me setting really high achievements for myself and having high standards for myself. I really put most of my time into it even when i couldn‘t play i spent as much time as possible listening to music and studying music theory because i had thie weird feeling of guilt because if not being able to play. \n\nI really want to have a career as a musician later in life (not particularly as a pianist, i also compose) and it‘s just so hard to get these weird vibes from my piano teacher, who i always looked up to and who was always so supportive and proud of me. \n\nBefore i met her today i got the feeling that i could feel like this but i just don‘t know what to do about it. It‘s so hard to succeed as a classical musician and it feels impossible with a chronic illness. I don‘t know how to motovate myself anymore\n\nI just wanted to get this out of me 🙏 ",

    "selftext": "Okay so, while working on my self care crafting time, I was thinking about just general mental health opinions I have that may be controversial, not well talked about, or just might be frowned upon for all I know. But I want to see if anyone else agrees with me in some of these topics.\n\nI apologize if anything here triggers anybody. I guess this is the trigger warning for discussions I’m bringing up.\n\nSo let me just rattle off these hot takes:\n\n1- I hate how cutesy every single self care and mental health product/book is. To me, healing is a gritty and hard thing to go through that takes a lot of time and work.\n\n2- Not all self care is relaxing. Sometimes it’s about coming to terms with past or future situations.\n\n3- Medications should be more of a last resort than what we’re given right off the bat. We go to a psychiatrist too soon rather than work through therapy and mental exercises for a bit.\n\n4- A lot of the push for mental health is to more make you a working employee again.\n\n5- Evaluations for diagnosis should not take a single day and should involve thorough discussions. We get misdiagnosed too often.\n\n6- On the flip side of the working employee, we shouldn’t take too many “mental health” days off work, but rather learn to work with our minds on really tough days. This of course excludes things like grief.\n\n7- I don’t like behavioral hospitals/ psych wards. It doesn’t really help you besides shove meds down your throat, give you a few worksheets to do, and a lot of the time you’re staring at a TV screen or trying to find something to do.\n\n8- you should have multiple things that help you out in your mental toolbox than just one or two things. Having back-ups when you are unable to do a main coping skill is very important.\n\n9- No coping skill or advice will work for everyone. On the flip side, you should try out all advice you’re comfortable with to see what works or doesn’t for you.\n\n10- Psych holds should be shorter unless absolutely necessary. Voluntary should be 1 day with no meds, 3 days with meds, and max 1 week for involuntary. Also, a voluntary person should be allowed to sign themselves out if they hit the right criteria.\n\n11- There should be a hotline for just venting issues rather than absolute crisis or in need of immediate help. Those managing the hotline would be volunteers or students in certain college majors.\n\n12- A lot of mental health issues come from not taking care of our bodies well enough.\n\nDue to the word limit, I can explain more in comments and share more thoughts",

    "selftext": "You see, I have been commissioning artists for about 7 years(21 years old). Almost 4 years ago, I started paying animators and artists that worked on tv shows, movies, anime, and video games. It has been a slippery ride but until about a year ago, it has been enjoyable. It say this cause while I have been able to pay some of the artists I wanted, some have not been available or don't do commissions. This was fine until some months ago, where there was this artist who worked on a video game I wanted to try paying. I did contact them years ago but i wasn't able to commission them due to a problem I caused. I did apologize to her some months ago and she was willing to put me on a commission list but recently she told me she closed indefinitely. That got me pretty upset to the point I broke a phone and tablet(note it wasn't the main phone I was using, it was my old replacement phone). A day ago, I tried finding animators who worked on an obscure  Japanese film back in the 80's and I strangely find one who had a website(not super common) and did storyboards for American cartoons too. It got myself so excited to the point that when I saw the email saying she was retired, it got me so sad to the point I started crying at work. In between all this, trying to commission people that worked on these type of things had been more frustrating, as I made a commitment to stop paying fanartists shortly after I was 18, and I am now scared at times to read emails relating to availability. Altogether, I'm starting to not have fun with commissions and I am starting to lose parts of my sanity. It's hard to cope with being disappointed or hearing no anymore. I don't wanna stop commissioning, but I wish I could back to when I was 18 or 14 and stopped myself. Note I am not mad at the animators.",

    "selftext": "I've been really struggling lately. Just feeling like everything is crumbling around me and spiraling out of control. But, I've been here before. So I emailed my therapist who told me she was on medical leave for a little while but would book with me as soon she could and in the meantime, she thought I could get through it but reach out to crisis lines or go to the hospital if things got worse.\n\nThings got worse and I needed someone to talk to, so I texted the crisis line. They spent most of the time asking the same routine questions that ended up wasting the time I could have spent talking about what was bothering me. I know they have to ask certain questions to establish safety but asking me if I've tried a bunch of different coping strategies when I just said I'm so depressed I physically can't move isn't helpful. I've been through this before. Trust me when I say I've tried everything I can. I'm just looking for you to listen. \n\nAnd then, at the hour mark, regardless of how I'm feeling, I get the \"is there anything else you want to discuss before we start wrapping up here\"? And I'm like ?? I just said I don't feel safe?? And we're just going to ignore that and start wrapping up? And the response I got was \"we're a crisis line. You can call back if you're in a crisis.\" Which, after clarifying what that meant, I found out that apparently you're only in a crisis if you're actively engaging in suicidal behavior at that second.\n\nThe irony is, because my mental health conditions are so chronic, I've been told numerous types to seek out proactive, preventative care because my suicidal thoughts can become behaviors very quickly. And yet, there's no resource that is offering that proactive help. So I guess I have to wait until it's \"bad enough\" again to get help from a crisis line.\n\nAnd yes, I know crisis lines are overused and probably understaffed. They are doing their best and without proper time limitations, calls could go on forever. I'm not saying anything bad about the volunteers or workers. They're doing the best they can with the resources and training they have. This is a systemic problem and I'm just feeling sorry for myself.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I began hearing voices in June of 2020. At first, they had me convinced there were people in my attic talking about me, and that cameras were all over my house. They had me convinced my family hated me, and that my husband was cheating on me. I could hear their voices talking about me, saying awful things. My family watched me fall apart, and I don't know if they just didn't know how to help, or what, but no one helped me. I lost my sanity, my marriage, and my privacy. These voices knew my every thought and everything I had ever done. They mocked me as I showered, and berated me as I tried to use the restroom.  I became increasingly suicidal.  The voices changed after they realized I had no support. They began comforting me. I had already struggled severely with MDD, and was severely isolated. They became my friends, when I had none. They began saying they were ghosts. I hear my mother, and my sister, and pretty much anyone I want. Part of my brain believes it, but the logical side knows I'm just sick. I have developed relationships with my voices though. They want to live through me. Everything i experience, they experience. We pick out meals together, we watch movies together, we laugh together. I have even fallen in love with one of the voices. I have many comforting voices, but I also have horrid ones. Ones that hate me. They can also take over my body and make me do things. They put me in what they call \"spectator mode\", and they live my life in my body. I can see everything they are doing, but I have zero control. They hit me sometimes. I could go on for hours about the things they do to me. I need them though. They are the only friends and support I have. My psychiatrist says I'm the only one she knows of that have these experiences with their voices. She calls it MDD with psychotic features. I guess I'm just looking for some insight, and maybe to connect with someone that has a similar story. Do many people have supportive and helpful voices? These voices have different personalities, and there are good and bad. The bad tell me to kill myself, an force me to stand naked in front of the mirror to mock me. The good ones comfort me and encourage me to take medicines and do therapy. I hate the bad stuff, but I willingly deal with it because I need the good ones. I would appreciate any input on this please! Thank you in advance, and I apologize for the lengthy post. ",

    "selftext": "I'm not really where to start or how to articulate it properly but i am going to give it a go.\n\n  \nI \\[Male\\] have been struggling a lot with understanding myself and the way i operate and have operated through out my relationships. For a long time, i have questioned myself as to why i would get a sudden change in mood when my partner would announce she was having a night to her self or some time away. It sends me into a feeling of dread and loneliness.\n\nIt leaves me to the point where i don't want to do anything and end up thinking when would i be back with her, even though it would probably be only a day or 2 until i see her again. Now, this feeling has never been anger towards her or the fact that i don't understand everyone needs time to themselves. Its important for everyone to have their time and rejuvenate and especially when someone has a lot going on outside of the relationship like she has. I don't fear anything bad is going to happen to her, or that anything bad is happening, i just get an immense feeling of missing her and my moods are different. I get stuck and just don't feel happy. I don't feel to eat, struggle to sleep and just want to be with her again. But i have also took on board and learning to be better at listening to her needs also. \n\n  \nIts caused unnecessary stress on to her, as my moods are obviously recognizable which i thought i was getting good at keeping to myself (i really wasn't), but in reality your partner knows when something is wrong. Ive got tired of feeling like that and letting it bring the person i truly love down. \n\nSo i have tried to look into finding out why i am the way i am. So i can do better for myself and the others around me. I came across Separation Anxiety and it did start to resonate in many ways. It seems to be a condition that forms in childhood, due to significant changes or loss. This usually stems from your parents or care givers.\n\nNow my childhood was not the worst i know for sure but it was difficult at many many times. My parents split up when i was 6 or 7 years old and as my life has gone on, i have started to notice how much it affected me, seeing it happen at such a young age. I remember the day it happened as it was my Mum who left the house, i remember seeing her at front door and crying for her. She also drank lots whilst i was growing up and i always knew of the concern it was doing to her health and would try vent it to her. I was told about money debts that we had from a young age. Just a lot of things for a child to take in and not no what to do with. \n\nI don't blame my parents for the outcome but i do know how much it has affected me as an adult and has left me feeling crazy for the way i am and have been. I really want to get better, and get things under control. I am just trying to find out how to.\n\nI am not even sure if i have said what i wanted to ask properly and nervous about even posting this, but any inputs or suggestions are great.\n\n  \nWhat would people say is a good way of getting out of or getting under control, Separation Anxiety as an adult? Because i really need to.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I am looking for others who might be experiencing this and could give me some insight or if you know of someone who might be struggling with it as well. Positive, insightful, helpful comments only please. Side note: I am on antidepressants, vitamin D, magnesium, DIM, etc.. I have had my blood levels checked and i've tried bioidentical hormones.\n\nI have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, CPTSD, depression and OCD over the years. I have also been told it sounds like I could I have bipolar, but then told I am not. So I'm kind of at a loss.  It all first started as early as I can remember. Most of the time I am easy to get along with, happy and positive. But every few months, a switch turns on in my brain and I am bombarded with massive amounts of anxiety, depression, panic, OCD and irritability.  It's very hard to function in these episodes. I don't feel like myself at all. I find it hard to deal with my kids especially. I have thoughts of leaving them, my husband, quitting my business, etc.. It's like the positivity gets turned off in my brain and the feeling of dread and impending doom takes over. Fortunately, they don't seem to last. But the 2 - 3 weeks is 100% hell and I am concerned that it will not actually go away this time.  I don't know if maybe this is a form of bipolar or my body is simply purging all the stress that has been built up. I have two kids, I own my own business, and well, the world and economy is not the greatest. All of which create a lot of tension in my life so I realize that some of the stress I have is normal and healthy. But to go from being able to handle my life, to not being able to handle the simplest tasks is exhausting and I'm starting to lose hope. Is this something I just have to accept about myself? Do these sound like bipolar episodes? Does anyone else experience this? Any answers or even words of encouragement would be amazing. Sorry this is so long. Thank you for taking the time to read it.",

After that she became slightly kinder to me and we texted much more.\n\nThere once was a not so nice situation between me and her friends and I decided to step away from her for a moment so I could calm down a bit, during that time she started apologizing and saying that she's worried about me and that she doesn't want me to suffer because of that.

I told her about it and I genuinely thought she would back down after hearing about it but she keeps telling me that it's okay and that everyone has their own flaws and that she accepts it. I thought she would immediately loose interest in me because of that but her behavior towards me didn't even change a little bit. People usually lose their feelings for me after discovering my disorders so I was surprised.\n\nAfter she told me that she wasn't in a relationship before, I was even more scared. I like her too, but I am afraid she would change her mind once we get into an official relationship. She has no experience in dating either dating a mentally ill person, I have a feeling that once she realizes that dating somebody like me isn't that easy, she would get disappointed. Because of my disorder, I have attachment problems and I don't want to get attached to a person who would probably dump me after a while of dating.\n\nI asked my friends for opinions but since they all want the best for me, they all tell me to just get into relationship with her and just see how it goes.

I’m reaching out here because I feel completely lost and don’t know where else to turn.  \n\nFor the past five years, I’ve endured constant mental and physical abuse from my parents. This has left me feeling deeply depressed and suffering from insomnia. My mental health has deteriorated to the point where I often feel hopeless and disconnected from myself.  \n\nHere’s what’s been happening:  \n\n- No Freedom or Control: My parents make every decision for me. They forced me into an online course I had no interest in, without my consent, and they control every aspect of my life, from my education to my career. I can’t even leave the house or make basic choices for myself.  \n\nCareer Sabotage: I’ve had to reject job offers because they didn’t align with what my parents wanted. This constant interference has destroyed my confidence and made me feel like I’ll never be able to stand on my own feet.  \n\nIsolation and Fear: I feel like a prisoner in my own home. The abuse both mental and physicalhas taken a huge toll on me. I’ve lost my sense of identity, and every day feels like a struggle just to survive.  \n\nI’m reaching out because I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. My mental health is at an all-time low, and I fear that this situation might push me toward self-harm or worse. I feel trapped, powerless, and completely alone.  \n\nIf anyone here has experienced something similar or has advice on how to cope with this kind of situation, I’d be incredibly grateful. Are there resources or techniques that can help me regain some sense of control over my life? How can I deal with the overwhelming anxiety and depression I feel every day?  \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this.

    "title": "Do you think the mainstream conversation about mental health has gotten too individualistic?",
    "selftext": "I think that the change in how we talk about mental health is overwhelmingly positive. I think it's great that we're moving away from shame based approaches, from categorizing everyone as either \"normal\" or \"crazy,\" etc, etc.\n\nBut I will say that these trends have kind of led us to a weird and unhealthy place. We get lots of soundbites regarding mental health that seem to prioritize \"protecting one's peace\" over all else, including how distancing yourself from those close to you affects them. I think buzzwords like \"toxic\" are being thrown around too eagerly. A truly toxic person should be cut out of your life, yes, but I think people who treat you that poorly are very few and far between, and cutting someone off is a major life decision that will seriously impact the other person, unless the other person is someone you don't know that well, like a recent Tinder match.\n\nI guess I'm just speaking from experience because I know someone who is cutting off immediate family members for basically no reason. This person gives vague, non-committal answers as to why they can't be bothered to text back like \"I just don't have the energy for \\[x person\\] right now\" or saying \"let me get back to you\" when asked if they can make plans.  I don't want to blame everything on these colorful instagram \"treat yo' self\" stories, but I do think this person's behavior is partially influenced by this new hyper-individualistic approach to mental health, and the idea that you don't owe anyone your time, energy, or even an explanation as to why you're being so uncommunicative. \n\nI think that when people are so wrapped up in wearing their self-diagnosis as a badge of honor, or are constantly ruminating on their victimhood, or are labelling every minor disagreement or even just lack of 100% enthusiastic support for their decisions as \"toxic behavior,\" it doesn't seem to leave much room for introspection. I think that when every single aspect of one's approach to mental health is about trying to make yourself as happy and comfortable as possible all of the time, there's a critical component missing; your actions also affect other people, and your personal comfort should not be your only priority in life.\n\nI think what's tricky about this is that therapy is inherently self-focused and may not be helpful in this situation.  Does your therapist ever ask you to think about how your actions are affecting others? Mine does from time to time, but for the most part the conversation is about what's affecting me. I think if someone isn't getting that directive for self reflection from therapy, and they're not getting it from friends or family because they're labelling every interaction that they don't 100% agree with as \"toxic,\" that person is just going to spiral deeper and deeper into their self absorbtion.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.",

    "selftext": "Its a throwaway I created to vent about this months ago after an accident, then I thought just let it be whats another year but now its hard, its just so hard for me to go on. I'm 22 now, grew fast in a broken home, mother had inherited something that made her angry all the time. I knew that she loved me but just never felt loved, same with my father. I grew up seeing him angry all the time, screaming yelling at me and my brother, even beating us every now and then but I did respect him because while my mother was in comma for a year when I was 2, he took care of me, my brother and my mother. But he was abusive, violent and used to hit my mother. I just hid behind books, never talked to them never ate together, never laughed together, I remember once I was sleepy and I hugged my father and we both almost fell asleep while hugging each other while standing, it was just funny I think, its the best memory of my father I have.\n\nI remember once, he sat me in front of them while they fought, I was 11, I remember every word that was said in that argument, they hit each other then my mother went silent and he came to me bent me between his thighs and elbowed my back, I peed my pants. My first ever memory with him is him beating me because he didn't like my hardwriting ( which is funny because I never write anymore I'm a CS Major). That's the memories I have with my father, my whole house is messed up I've seen my uncles and father physically fight my grandfather, seen my uncle beat my father, seen my mother with black eye, seen my grandmother cussing my great grandmother, seen all sorts of shit.\n\nBut I never cried, complained. never showed that it affected me, always looked at some kid begging at the side of street and thought \"You're better off\", I never let anything control me God damnit I had a brother to save from this, I kept my head down studied hard, got into Engineering and passed top of my class, got a job offer $ 60k P.A. equivalent and then I had an accident and went bedridden for 5 months. The company that hired me didn't want me anymore, I couldn't get a job had to stay at my parents.\n\nAgain told myself \"You're better off, you have intellect, prospect and health, you can do anything\" and started preparing for a Master's exam to justify a gap on my CV. Recently, my father had an argument with my brother and he searched my brother's things found a Bra and a sundress. My brother is a closeted transgender or just crossdresser IDK. I thought I just had to work hard, get out, get help to my brother and I'll work on myself afterwards, I'll be better for others, I will break the cycle. But seeing my brother suffer because of this overprotective, narcissist, toxic man who never let him go out with people, never let him do anything because he thought my brother wasn't \"Mature Enough\" broke me.\n\nBut I'm tired now, I can't do this anymore. I can't be alone with my thoughts, always earphones in my ears, its so dark I can't even sleep without listening to music. Its been years since I've just talked to myself, I feel pity for myself and I don't like it. Friends in parties passing me smokes, I can't smoke because I'm scared that I'll break and do something or say something, I can't drink with my friends because I'm scared. I'm just so scared now, what if I'm like my father, what if I inherited whatever my mother has.\n\nIG me and this stupid loud music will keep on going for as long as I can drag myself.",

After a while I stood up and started walking again.\n\n\n What i didn't know of is that there was someone who saw me harming myself and thought that I was taking a drug injection because it was really dark and drug injections r a thing in Egypt and that guy called his friends. I was confused at the time and didn't understand anything. They pinned me down, kept insulting me and making fun of me and asking me what were u hitting? u son of a bitch. I was frozen and helpless and of course I stayed silent. I wouldn't tell them I was cutting myself with a piece of glass, but I told them that it wasn't an injection.

I'll try to be as concise as I can but this is somewhat difficult as this is a new experience for me. \n\nI've recently recovered from a bout of mycoplasma. My body was beaten down pretty bad, and I had a bad bout of gastritis as well. It was stressful but nothing new and I've grown to deal with these things. Would not be the first time getting that sick, but it's affected me more than physically this time. \n\nBut after my illness, and some psychological evaluations, it seems I've been hit by a pretty heavy burst of anxiety, or maybe mild depression. And I'm usually a very easily self motivated individual, and while there's a very good chance for my recovery to be quick, given that this is very recent and my experience according to my psychologist is likely just my body being chemically imbalanced and a matter of time. Coping with anxiety which to me had manifested like the nigh inability or want to do anything, I feel paralyzed at times unless I'm almost dragged to do things (like work). I only ever feel the will to do things in groups and it becomes difficult even then. \n\nAre there are any good coping mechanisms or ways to regain my willpower?  Is there anything I can do aside from push myself to work and enjoy things to get out of this hole or is the only medication to fight through it til it goes away?\n\nAnd if anyone has experienced this heavy burst of anxiety after an illness. Like being hit by a bag of sand that's weighing you down at all times. How did you cope with it and for how long?\n\nThis is a draining experience and new for me so any help would be greatly appreciated. ",

They say it’s because she has such negative energy and brings everyone else down which I can definitely feel but I know she can’t help it so I do my best to not let it effect our relationship. It’s just hard cause it feels like im constantly walking on eggshells trying not to upset her.\n\nIm constantly trying to help her not be as miserable with small gestures that I don’t HAVE to do but I know I can an I CHOOSE to for her but not it seems like she just expects me to do them and gets upset anytime I can’t for one day! For example her depression for the most part began with toxic friends and them abandoning her so I sit with her every lunch even though I have an early release and would much rather be at home. If I can’t sit with her even one day because I have things I need to do for cheer she gets so mad at me even though (at the moment) she has a few friends she can sit with. I try everything I can to make sure she knows I’m not abandoning her but she doesn’t listen to me if she realizes I’m not staying.\n\nIdk how to explain it but it’s just like she’s always complaining about the bad and what she doesn’t have and can’t seem to see the small things that I can give her… I get that she has depression and that effects her mindset but it just seems like she doesn’t even try to think about things differently which just makes things worse for herself and idk how fo help. Anytime someone tries to give her advice on how to look at things in a little bit more of a positive way she just kind of brushes it off, I’ve noticed she’s done this with her therapist too. The worst part about all of this is I know it’s not a lack of effort and he can’t help it and it has affected my mental state drastically but I can’t tell her any of this! I have to keep all my feelings hidden because I love her so much and don’t want them to negatively impact her. Even just feeling this way makes me feel like a terrible and unsupportive sibling 😖 I just wish I could understand her pov",

    "selftext": "I found the practice of cold exposure in all sorts of ways and in the right dosage (cold showers, cold baths, walking just in my shirt in the cold) truly beneficial in terms of having a bigger capacity to process emotions and so calming down the mind. I experienced that the the emotions are kind of the fuel for many of overwhelming thoughts and by processing the emotions also my mind becomes much more still. There is a beautiful subreddit also specifically on that topic r/Emotional_Healing \n\nI am not only talking about using the cold for self - regulation (which works well) and calming down the mind, I am also talking about having more space or being able to handle bigger loads of emotions so to say without being overwhelmed, tired ect...\n\nI took me quite some years to figure out how much cold exposure is actually good and how much is actually counter productive. In the beginning I was doing way too much to finally arrive at the point that actually not much cold exposure is needed to increase the baseline of our emotional capacities.\n\nNow a days, I take maybe 1-2 Ice baths in nature a week in the cold season staying inside max. of 2 minutes, often also only one minute. really depends how I am feeling. I try to fully calm down inside of the cold and to enjoy and embrace it. I try to avoid \"forcing\" myself doing it for the sake of ticking a box of another practice that should benefit me. I try to approach it as a practice of self- love and to remind myself of the tremendous strength & instinctive power I have inside of myself.\n\nI also use cold showers everyday, usually starting with the warm shower and slowly and gradually making the water colder. This helps me to stay relaxed fully and not to build up resistance.\n\nI can definitely feel that the cold kind of increases the my \"baseline\" of feeling good and making wiser decisions. \n\nApproaching the cold in a very sensitive way really helped to to enjoy the practice and sustain it over long, long time.\n\nWhat love to hear if you could observe how the cold practice impacted your emotional & mental state?\n\nIf you havent tried, GO for it (slowly & easy), I feel the cold is such an incredible teacher and healer",

On and off again for the last two or three years, we have been going to couples counselling because I often feel like she isn't attracted or interested in me, and sex is non-existent in our marriage. She was having a bad day a few weeks ago and came to me to ask for sex. Surprised, I asked, why now? She never wants sex. Her response made me want to vomit. She said since she can't cut or self-harm herself like I have to myself, she has sex with me instead. \n\nSHE COMPARED SEX WITH ME TO SELF-HARM!\n\nI understand that I am not a \"catch\" when it comes to relationships (or life). I have struggled with my self-esteem for a long time. As a child, I was diagnosed with the R-word, Autism/PDD, epilepsy, multiple learning disabilities, and a speech impairment. My diagnosis paperwork includes phrases like \"unlikely to succeed at life.\" I'm not the smart kind of autistic; I fail at school and struggle with the everyday things that come naturally and easily for everyone else. It feels overwhelming trying to conform to neurotypical standards. Consequently, I have struggled with Major Depression, Psychosis, and self-harm. Moreover, I am an ugly person. I have bad acne (possibly hidradenitis), I have crooked teeth, I am overweight, and I have enough scars from self-harm to frighten most people on sight.\n\nDespite all this, I am making a real effort to be better. I will be seeing a new dermatologist in June. I might be able to afford braces in a year or two. I exercise regularly, and I have so far lost between 50-60 lbs. in the last two years (not enough, but I am trying). I see a therapist 1-2 times a week. \n\nWhat's the use in ANY of this if I am so horrible of a person that sex with me is comparable to self-mutilation?! I feel like I might as well give up now. How will working out at the gym fix this? How will therapy fix this? I'm so bad that sex with me is the equivalent of self-harm. I feel like I might as well just unalive myself. It worked for my father and father-in-law. \n\nI can’t process there being anything more wrong with me than what there already is. \n\nI’m fat, ugly, r-word, and apparently the only woman to have had sex with me compares it to self-harm.

Since we were younger, she’s had these really intense depressive episodes, especially circle around her period. She was recently diagnosed with meiosis, but these depressive episodes are pretty debilitating for her. She is also a person, but there are a lot of times where she lacks that empathy completely and just shuts down. I noticed that it’s one other people are happy and celebrating themselves, like her sister will have a graduation or a birthday or I will have certain events and occasions and it’s always in the moments that we especially need best friends support that she will be taken over by an intense range of emotions to the point where she shuts down, and by shut down, I mean, is not there, like physically will not show up for you and will have a very dramatic night in which she is crying to her family (she lives at home still, she’s about 27). Then, after the fact, instead of addressing what happened and apologizing for not being there for us, she will instead want to have a serious conversation about something completely unrelated that she claims she is hurt from you over. Like we completely divert attention away from her just simply stating that she wished she could’ve been there, and instead will try to victimize herself by grasping at straws. \n\nI’m so confused, is this some type of defense mechanism or avoidance of some sort?  I just don’t think it’s normal to have these depressive episodes so frequently, and be so impacted by them show up for the people around you, for the people who are showing up for you, and then have the inability to address it, instead of victimize yourself to divert attention away from how you could’ve possibly hurt somebody, regardless of whether or not the hurt was intentional.",

    "selftext": "First of all I am diagnosed as OCD, by three different doctors but I fail to believe them. Growing up I was exposed to porn when I was 9 years old, now I am a 27 years old male and feel worse over the years. It all started with regular porn and I  remember in my 12 or 13 years seeing a bestiality video that still hunts me till this day. I don’t remember masturbating to it but the fact that I just googled it and saw it and probably enjoyed the scene as a child makes me want to puke now.\nWhen I was 15 I got some sexual interactions with a boy my age , we used to to watch porn together and talk about sex obsessively and one day when we were playing a tag game he forced me to the ground and fondled me for 20 minutes or more. I could feel his erecting dick in my anus and it was all done over clothes, I tried to resist but he was tougher. That incident has affected my sexuality and I became more attracted to men then escalated to gay porn as a way out. Some doctors say it was abuse some don’t they tell me it was a childhood experience because I have hit puberty when I was 16.\nYears have passed and my attraction to men grew more and more. Then I felt bad for myself and wanted to be straight like my peers in order to marry one day, I forced myself to watch straight porn which made me very uncomfortable and ruined my mental health even worse. I develooed intrusive thoughts about incest , pedophilia and paraphilia in general and have been suffering since 5 years now.\nSadly and ironically enough, I got curious one day to discover what pedos talk about online in their forums because I liked hunting pedos documentaries and locking them down. I found a twitter account and I saw death in my eyes when I clicked a link it was two pedophilic pictures that made me lose hope in life.\nI feel like my pocd stems from this incident as well as intrusive thoughts originating from porn. \nI have never consumed willingly or enjoyed or masturbated to any intrusive thoughts instead I became very avoidant of my family and animals and everything.\nToday, I feel desperate. Never been in a relationship, still consuming gay porn, still craving to sleep at night like regular people and ashamed of my porn past. It was only one video of bestiality, I didn’t know what I was doing back then as a teen I even forgot details my age was around 10-13 and .\nAm I zoophile? Will I turn into one? Am I a pedo ? Am I incestuous?\nI am sure that I am into both men and women. But the rest is killing me. \nI lost weight and almost got fired because of ruminations.\nI am so scared because imagine you had a child and found out that has seen zoophilia in his search history wouldn’t that mean I will grow up as a pervert and might like animals sexually? \nI want to hold onto life and be happy for one single hour.\n1. Was my situationship with the boy abuse or did I ask for it?\n2. Is curiously searching about pedos a proof that I am a sex offender?\n3. Did the bad stuff I seen in porn like zoophilia mean that I have a thing for animals?\n4. Lastly can I recover from OCD?",

I’m overwhelmed by how much I want to change, but I feel like I’m dragging this invisible weight behind me.\n\nGrowing up, my parents were strict, especially my father. He was often critical, calling me names like ‘lazy’ or ‘useless.’ I rarely felt like I was good enough. My mother wasn’t very involved, and I didn’t have much emotional support. I struggled in school and felt like I could never measure up. Even now, I hear those voices in my head when I try to push myself to do something.\n\nI think a lot of my procrastination comes from fear—fear of failure, fear of not being good enough, fear of proving that voice in my head right. I get paralyzed and avoid things that matter to me, even though I know it’s hurting me. I also struggle with self-discipline because part of me just wants to avoid discomfort, even if it means I stay stuck.\n\nI want to be consistent. I want to build better habits and take care of myself. I don’t want to feel like I’m wasting my potential anymore. But it’s so hard to take the first step, and I don’t know how to stop this cycle of inaction. I feel like I’m fighting against a part of myself that just wants to stay in my comfort zone.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? How do you start moving forward when you feel so stuck? How do you heal from a childhood that feels like it still has a grip on you? Any advice or insights would mean so much to me right now.",

The guy is very good and I agree with a lot of the things he says. I thought to myself at the start of last year I'm sick of feeling less than okay most of the time. So I knuckled down and threw everything I could at my mental health. Sometimes it worked great. But sometimes I would become obsessed with helping myself and trying to learn more techniques.\n\nSometimes I would listen to something Dr Scott said on YouTube and panic because I would think I'd been doing it all wrong and that I had to figure it all out or I wouldn't get better. I'm pretty sure I have OCD and this is a manifestation of it. In the last 3 months it got so bad. I was trying to fix every bad thought and feeling I had. It was really distracting me from what mattered to me. I got so fixated on the results of the techniques, that sometimes I would get a result from the treatment, but then feel really underwhelmed, like it should have felt better than it did.\n\nI realised that I was getting really fixated on the results to the point where nothing felt enough for me, like I was always left wanting more. So I stopped everything. No more trying to fix myself. The thoughts can come and stay as long as they need to while I get on with living the best life I possibly can. It was difficult but after a while I started to realise my thoughts and feelings werent so bad. Most of them were temporary and would go away eventually. I felt that I could allow myself to feel what I needed to feel and they werent all things that needed to be neutralised. \n\nI found I naturally started taking better care of my physical needs. I started going for more walks, brushing my teeth more and showering. I really  think that it was my fixation on trying to fix my mental health the actually made it worse in the long run. I just had the best week I have had for a very long time. Not perfect all the way through had to experience some negative thoughts and feelings, but it didn't feel half as bad as it did when I was trying to fix myself all the time. Granted, I had a week off work last week and went on a getaway, but I genuinely don't think it would have been as good if I hadn't stop doing what I was doing.\n\nMy problem is that sometimes I still feel like I can't cope and feel doubtful about whether I should go and see a therapist privately. I do have the money for it. But I don't want to end up going back down the same route of obsessing over fixing myself. ",

I used to be very closed off, self harmed for long periods in my life since I can remember and grew up a bit too early.

Don’t get me wrong, I go to work every day, I studied my ass off for a year course and I was taking some care of myself. I spent 5 years in therapy as a child before I met my first supportive social worker/psychologist. Therapy wasn’t my friend no matter how hard I put time in. I missed school because of therapy but also I needed therapy because of the bullying & shaming I received all throughout my school years. \n\nI can’t keep my room tidy, no matter how hard I try.

I know this isn’t my lowest but each day I feel more tired, more fatigued, I experience random bursts of energy, my social battery diminishes within 15 minutes of being around others, I can get easily irritated, everything feels so hard to catch up with that it causes me more pain to sit here with my life and be seen as someone who is lazy, unmotivated, dirty.

    "selftext": "Both 23 years old, we had a four-month relationship that felt super healthy (our first relationship for both), we always prioritized communication, and sharing emotional feelings no matter how harsh they felt. I knew she was an avoidant attachment type of person which I was okay with, she promised she's really comfortable with the connection and that I needed to be more patient with her because she sees this working out as long as everything goes at a slow pace. We had the best four months of our lives, with the most open, honest, and loving connection one could want.\n\n2 days ago, she texts me an \"I miss you\" text, that is immediately followed up by an \"I need to tell you something\", she goes on about how romantic closeness overwhelms her and that she's not ready for a relationship (classic, I know), I talk her through it, and things are good again, she says she was just stressed out and was thankful I helped ground her. The next day goes great again, but halfway through I get an unexpected passive agressive message that we need to talk and that I don't understand her. She says she had this fear of closeness from the start, and that she hid it because she didn't feel it was relevant to the relationship but instead a personal issue (wtf), she argued she forced herself to fall into a relationship because she valued how the other person showed interest and wanted to show interest herself, but apparently because it felt new for her she thought it was best to quit everything, she didn't even bother giving my side of the story a chance, or care to consider my propositions to bring the relationship back to a healthy point, she immediately wanted to end everything, we sat in silence for like 15 minutes and then hung up.\n\nI know this is classic avoidant attachment behavior, and it is partly my fault for choosing to be with someone like this. But from my side I was promised she was working on herself and told that she valued the connection enough to work on it. Constant reassurances from her that this would work out, and that she sees a future, and all the fake hopes and promises made me commit like I never have before, only to be left to feel like an idiot, falling for someone who was just experimenting with their emotions, and cared so little about the relationship.\n\nI'm angry, depressed, betrayed and confused all at once, I have no idea what to do. Part of me misses her dearly, and the other part wants to see her suffer for this. I know four months isn't long, but for someone's first relationship and for how good it seemed, it felt like way more, and I genuinely can't express the hurt and depression I find myself in right now. I have no idea if I should try to save the connection again considering how dumb I feel her decision was, or if I should walk away seeing how non cooperative she was (even if it was during a moment of high emotion, I still am scared it would happen again).",

I have ever publicly expressed any hatred or ill feelings towards this person. I have always stated from the beginning that it was not his fault. and that the real fault behind it was me genuinely not being able to take feeling like a second option. I also am diagnosed with schizophrenia so i just thought it was the best decision for both party’s to go separate ways. After he saw my post, he immediately took it as me trying to be “ cocky “ or rude. And made multiple public videos calling me out as to the “ horrible and sick insane “ person i “really was” . This hurt immensely because i still loved and cared for this individual, Yet just chose my mental health over a friendship. he decided to text him following threats to make my partner believe i was being unfaithful. That is where i drew the line and decided to reach out to him just trying to assert that i meant no ill or hate towards him whatsoever. But the things he continued to say following my messages even when i made it crystal clear that i just genuinely wanted to seal the deal and clear the air. The way he responded to me broke me down so bad to the point where i almost admitted myself to a psychic treatment. It did a lot of damage coming from a person i once cherished, loved and cared more about anything. If anyone’s curious to see the messages let me know and i’ll add them to the thread. But my main question overall was…\n\nis it not the same to antagonize someone with a mental disorder, to antagonize someone for their sexuality? \nbeing called those things hurt as it is because i already feed it into myself daily 24/7. \nJust looking for advice as to whether or not it is in some way just as harmful and offensive as any slur used towards LGBTQ people.\nThank you.",

    "selftext": "Ever since I was a kid, my parents had never believed in mental illnesses. They always just said \"Shake it off you'll be fine.\" or \"We're not taking you to get checked for this.\". I've always felt like I was a bit crazy even when I was in middle school/high school (I'm 24 now.) I have probably the lowest attention span out of anyone I've ever known. I'll sit down to watch a YouTube video or play a game and I'll get bored within 5 minutes so I get up to pace around while I listen to music and that'll last for maybe a minute and then I'll go back to the video and then get bored and switch to something else and on and on for the entirety of my life. Sometimes my mind is so alive and constantly firing that I'll hold conversations with people that aren't there. I don't hear them like they're different people or anything I know it's me talking to myself, but I feel completely insane when I do it.\n\nI always have felt like I have some sort of anxiety since I was little. Every time I go out in public I feel like every single soul is looking at me and it's hard for me to even focus on a conversation with someone because my attention is constantly focused on everyone else's eyes to see if they're looking at me or not.\n\nI also have always had extremely intense mood swings for seemingly no reason. I feel like I'm at the same time a very emotional person and also not at all. Depression has been hitting hard lately and I've had thoughts of self-harm and all of that in the past. One tiny thing could set my entire mood off, even if I've had the best day of my life, to the most depressed I've ever felt. It feels like every single negative thing that could happen, no matter how big or small, is the straw that broke the camel's back but I also feel very emotionally unavailable and unable to relate to people emotionally. I've always had trouble holding onto steady relationships with a partner. I've always been very clingy and filled with anxiety when it comes to that. \n\nAll of this has been weighing on me for so long that it feels like the norm. I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel so helpless not knowing what is wrong with me, because it definitely feels like something is wrong. I just have had these thoughts a lot recently and I didn't really know where to let it all out. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

In the beginning, he was my FP (favorite person), and I was completely obsessed with him in a way that felt intense and all-consuming—like typical BPD behavior. We got together after only a month and moved in together just two weeks later. Up until recently, everything seemed fine.\n\nBut in the past week, it’s like a switch has flipped inside me. I feel like I’m not in love anymore. I’m bored. I crave excitement, thrill, and new beginnings. What’s even more confusing is that this exact same thing happened in my last relationship: I was over the moon in the beginning, but as soon as the honeymoon phase ended, I couldn’t stand the person anymore—even though I still loved them.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m going crazy. Is this normal? Up until now, I’ve required so much validation and have been so scared of him leaving me or cheating on me. And he’s truly the kindest soul—the most supportive, loving person I’ve ever known. It breaks my heart that I’m now in a place where I don’t even know if I want to be with him anymore.\n\nI hate talking about my feelings. I avoid it at all costs because I hate hurting people. I’m such a people-pleaser, but this bored, empty, and resistant feeling inside me is overwhelming. \n\nWill it go away? Or is this just how things are going to be for me in relationships?",

I’ve had issues with people in the past not accepting it, so I try to weed out the type of people that would care about that stuff early on. She seemed kinda shocked when I told her the size, she then stopped responding and I woke up to see she blocked me. My feelings on this are weird, I’m not mad, sad, really I don’t feel anything pertaining to it besides maybe a tinge of disappointment. The thing is that I’m used to this, even as a little kid, members of my family would shame me and laugh at me for having a small penis when I was literally as young as seven. I guess I just don’t understand, I’m sure a lot of people wouldn’t care, but I just seem to keep running into only those that do care. Maybe I just need to put myself out there more, I’m not sure.

    "selftext": " My journey all started when I got knee surgery for my meniscus tear. \n\n I was an active person before my injury working out 14 hours a week and eating a well balanced diet, I got at least 8 or more hours of sleep each night. I also had all A’s in my classes and a wonderful group of friends. Overall my life was stable and perfect in all aspects. But, My struggles with depression, severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts then it turned into extreme anxiety and reclesness/impulse control. The first symptom I noticed was depression. So I got on an antidepressant but I didn’t take it because I thought it was gonna change and control me. So I switched to an antidepressant I actually took because I was administered it. A moth or two after depression started I noticed I was having suicidal thoughts and severe mood swings in a day so I got on a antipsychotic which helped a little. Then a month later I started to have extreme anxiety about things, for example I thought that I was in a dream and the only way to get out of it was to die. I also had anxiety about large crowds(but that's nothing new).  I Also  struggled with Impulse control and recklessness and ended up trying substances (deliriants) and was addicted to them. I didn’t care what happened to me. In these past few months I have been to three mental hospitals and one residential. A week ago I started school and have been in IOP. However, I struggled with nightmares and ended up staying awake for three days straight. I ended up starting to go into a psychosis due to lack of sleep. Everything was glitching due to hallucinations and I had a delusion that I was going to be schizophrenic in my next life so I should kill myself, I realized it was the closest thing I could get to delirium and I also felt Euphoric when I didn’t sleep. So this Sunday I decided to try staying up for seven days to get the full psychosis experiment. I am now finishing night two while writing this. All being said, I truly hate myself right now. My feelings for myself switch from feeling like I am superior to everyone to feeling like I am unlovable and I hate myself. I honestly hate my personality so much to the point I want to actually commit suicide. I don’t know if this is a personality disorder or if I am just actually stupid or crazy. If anybody relates to this please tell me because I don’t want to be alone in this.\n\n\n",

I've been in sales but never did too great even though people always thought I should be great at it. I'm fairly smart but can't ever stick with anything or follow through. Just smoked weed and played video games online with my crew and tried to have fun. After my accident my ex wife dumped over a text message on the day my Dr told me to get on my feet and to start walking again. She had cheated on me a couple years earlier and we had tried to work it out and then broke up a couple months before the accident, but because of the TBI I forgot about all of that. Fought and fought and fought to come back from everything, and I did. Started dating the ex wife of the dude my ex wife cheated on me with. She's an incredible woman, but our love languages are completely opposite. Her top two are quality time and acts of service. Mine are words and touch. She gets hers filled just by me being me. I don't get mine filled up at allllll. On top of all of the low T symptoms. I've been prescribed testosterone and Vyvanse but the prior auths haven't cleared yet. Had a big talk with my girl tonight and she said it's not her job to make me happy. Not her job to make me not depressed. I told her I understood that, but it is her job to make me feel loved. And I don't even feel like she's interested in who I am. I feel like I could die tomorrow and she'd be fine. Goddamn this is all so frustrating. I don't ever feel like I'm enough. I don't ever feel good enough. I can't make enough money to support myself and my whole world feels like it crashes around me almost every day. I can't take this yo. Feel like I'm losing it. I'm in therapy, but have no friends. I talk to my dog and my cat. They're the only true friends I have. I feel like I'm trying to communicate, but ineffectually. It's such a struggle to even get out of bed in the morning. Every single day I wake up I just tell myself to not let the hard days win. Just hang in there for another 24. But I'll be goddamned if I'm not fucking exhausted. I'm a good man with a huge fucking heart. What the fuck did I do to deserve this. Fuck me and fuck this miserable fucking thing called \"my life.\" I have dreams, I have goals. But I don't know how to get there. I don't know what to do. Everything I try to do I fail at anyway.

He gasped “i cant breathe” and i put his mask back on, and i told him it was gunna be alright and i wasn’t going to go anywhere and i was going to help him and he just looked at me and then silently choked on the air and died very quickly and it shocked me so much and i felt it was my fault for not realising how bad his condition was and for not keeping his oxygen mask on for longer. \n\nI was so scared to return to work the day after in case it happened again i called in sick and i went back in the day after\n\nThe next patient had aspiration pneumonia which is where you inhale your food and the lungs cant cough it up. When this happens your lungs create loads of phlegm and mucus to shift it but it doesn’t work and eventually you choke on your own snot. I knew this man was very poorly he was also on a high oxygen requirement and was kept nil by mouth because he had totally lost the ability to swallow (which is why he probably inhaled his food) but his position was not good in bed he had slid all the way down and looked very uncomfy. I didnt have anyone to help me lift him at that moment so i just started by helping my healthier patients get washed and dressed, i was gone maybe 30 mins when the nurse told me that he had died and i felt sad i had not helped him in time. When i went to do post mortem care on him his nose was completely blocked by thick snot and i rolled him he had all these respiratory secretions fall out his airway, it looked like someone had thrown a bowl of sick all over the bed and i knew that was the exact reason he had died because i had not repositioned him and he had choked to death because his airway was blocked. And i just feel such guilt\n\nToday we had another man die of hospital acquired pneumonia, his death wasn’t so sudden he slowly slipped away but it made me sad that i was not able to properly close his eyes and jaw and that yet another patient died in my care. I know they were all elderly and didn’t have long to live anyway but it makes me so sad and i feel such a sense of responsibility.\n\nDeath used to make me think i should live my life to the fullest when i was a porter and took patients down to the mortuary there was this sense of finality to it and it almost gave me a shove. A wakeup call to go out and live my life. Now working on the wards and being able to stop these things from happening i am living with such a sense of fear. I dont want to go out after work because im scared i could be stabbed or hit by a car or suddenly have a heart attack and i am even more afraid that the people i love i will lose too. Of course i will lose them one day, but my brain thinks they could just die any minute if i am not next to them.

She had to wear full sleeves to hide the scars. Then she started doing it on her legs, as \"no one will ever know\". She decreased the frequency over time. I am so shaken how can anybody be so depressed. And you can't even tell how she is from inside. She laughed normally at jokes and giggled with friends (I'm using past tense as I recently moved over to another city, so our only source is text n calls). Yes, she cries easily but other than that she always appeared fine to me. But I want to help her.\n\nShe told me that she was a mess,  too weak and pathetic for me, and she thinks she will pull me back from working at my full potential. She suggested yesterday that I leave her and focus on myself, and that I deserve better. Very very long story short, I love her too much to leave her like this, and besides she will need to fix herself sooner or later. And so I told her. (It was all over text, as I mentioned it's an LDR).  (No, thank you people, I trust her intentions behind her words completely.)\n\nSo far I have just told her that she must WANT to improve herself. She must stop calling herself a mess. I told her that she must try and change the thought when she feels like crying, for instance if she cries to bed, she must instead try to be be excited for tomorrow... But I know within that all my advice is completely hollow. If she is really that depressed and has a history of SH... she probably can't be excited for coming days.\n\nAlso, I don't think she would be comfortable with taking therapy, because if her mother finds this out... She isn't exactly sensitive towards her daughter. (Once her mother saw the SH scars. She handed her a knife and dared my girlfriend to harm herself in front of her.)\n\nShe has been in this pit since she was so young, and I want to fix her. I am really tensed and not sure how to tackle this. I don't even know where to start.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I don't really know what exactly to say so imma just yap about everything. \n\nAs I write, I'll add anything that may be triggering at all below this text as a trigger/content warning.\n•Depression / suicidal thoughts\n•References to OF and similar works\n•Mention of emotional abuse\n\n\nSo, I've recently fallen into a deep depression, for why I don't really know aside from some stuff with my sort of partner. Overall, my mental health has taken a toll to the point where I'm even getting fatter because I've become incredibly unhealthy in my eating habits. \n\nThat's only one thing and something I believe I can fix, but the rest feels more complicated. \n\nI'm an eighteen yr old trans man (who also sometimes likes to still be fem, that's just who I am), and so far I only have one job that doesn't even pay because it's just a thing to give me work experience so I can actually get a paying job, but recently I've started to panic because I don't know if I'll be able to get a paying job. I'm autistic to add to all this, so alot of stuff is more difficult for me.\n\nRecently I've been struggling to even go to my current job, to the point where my dad and my sister got annoyed at me. Both of them are concerned I'm turning into one of those people who just mooch off others and sit in their room and play video games. Sadly, my brother is like that, and he too is autistic, a few years older than me, and had had two jobs, one I believe was paying before he got fired. \n\nI don't want to be like that, I do want a paying job, there's a certain job I really want to, but it's hard to get into, especially if you don't have work experience, and even if you do have it, it's still difficult to get into, even though it is just retail. \n\nMy main issue here is money, I really need money so that when I eventually move into my dads to get away from my emotionally abusive mother, I can stay there no problem. \n\nRecently, it's gotten to the point where I'm starting to think of turning to a certain kind of work industry. I'm not exactly sure about the rules of talking about the kind of work so.. imma just say: of (not this specifically, but something very similar and not digital if you get my drift)\n\nThe thing is that there's multiple factors to figure out for this. I'm still technically dating someone (idk really how to describe it, I want to leave them but I cant so we're sort of on a break), I'm only eighteen, I'm a virgin, and of course I'm scared of catching something. \n\nI truly don't know what to do, I know of course I gotta go to work more and try and get a paying job, but honestly it's just really difficult to do anything of the sort. Going to work is difficult with just my body and the heat over here, and getting a job is also difficult because of course it is. \n\nI'm tired and have multiple times considered ending it but there's a few small things here and there that are helping me hold on a little longer. \n\nAnyway, that's all, hope y'all enjoyed my ranting. Any advice is appreciated, but of course no one has to if they don't want to, I just simply needed to get my thoughts off my chest for a while.",

    "selftext": "I’m an art student trying to go in for animation. I've made it so far in my life; I finished school, did college to get my AA, and now I’m in uni for a bachelor's. I’m really proud of myself for making it this far, especially since I’m a first-generation college student. Other than that, I’m just working on myself, working on my art, gym stuff, and working. For a while now, though, I’ve been meaning to talk to others just about how I think and feel to see if I can find relatability. So, I don’t like to say something I’m not unless it’s officially diagnosed, but I feel like I have ADHD; it has its pros and cons, especially for someone that’s creative like me. I like trying new mediums in art, and I’m even trying to buy an airbrush kit, but the biggest issue is commitment to any medium. I’ve always stuck with digital or pencil/charcoal but don’t stick too long with things like painting. I'm hyped about trying airbrushing and feel like this one might stick, and I’m hoping I can create a new piece with airbrushing. Other than this, I also have issues with overthinking and just always thinking about something. It feels like my brain is always working, my thoughts falling into a rabbit hole, like run-on sentences, topic after topic. I am also pretty self-aware, which is kind of cool but also makes me feel gross about myself sometimes. I started noticing early on my journey through grappling how much I liked sparring; it made me smile when someone would pull a throw on me, I would chuckle when they put me in an armbar, and adrenaline felt so good. It scared me; it felt like I liked violence or wanted a reason to fight. Later on there were moments when I wanted to be mean to people, get them angry and laugh at them, and give them a reason to fight me. At the end I was self-aware enough to know how stupid it is and how I would be an asshole for it. I want to be an asshole, a narcissist; I want to have a huge ego and make others feel shitty; I want to be petty. I read these AITAH posts, and when I know who is the AH, I always get these petty/revenge ideas of what I would do in their shoes. I even made a plan if I wanted to get revenge on someone; it’s pretty long, but the idea involved kidnapping, my suicide, and hiring people in the long run to prevent healing. I just want to be a villain and kill the heroes. But at the end, I’m not any of these things; I’m a chill dude that likes helping others and being social. I encourage others, give them hope in their dreams, and want to help others. These bad thoughts, though, they feel like intrusive thoughts but on crack, and I fight them every day. Telling myself that this isn’t a path worth following and I’m better than these feelings/thoughts. I’m wondering if anyone else has a feeling like this. \n",

Growing up I was always the \"perfect\" kid, the cousin that everyone gets compared to, the kid that parents never had to worry about, the one that just followed the rules and tried to prove themselves to their parents. Now it's been 3 years that I'm struggling with being in a \"stagnant\" or a \"motionless\" state, I feel chronically tired, I try to be outdoors as much as possible in the hopes of feeling something different but I just don't, I can't get anything done, I don't care abt my studies anymore, I feel like I'm physically and mentally stuck and there's no way out and there's nothing I can do about it, I hate myself and trick myself into thinking that I don't. Everything seems like a chore to me, the basic daily routine things are difficult tasks, taking a shower is hard, making food is hard, studying... don't even get me started on that, everything that I enjoyed before seems to not fill this emptiness that I'm feeling these days, and I can't talk about it because I myself can't explain, and if I do talk people would try and give me cliché advice that doesn't really help. I thought maybe if I talk about it it'll help me find a solution but it doesn't make me feel any better, I feel like a part of me is dead but I don't know when or where it died. I don't want to be seen but at the same time I don't want to stay home and be a prey for my thoughts so I go out begging myself to feel something but I just...can't seem to feel anything, then by the end of the week all of the void from those days accumulate and a wave of questioning my whole being overwhelms me and the cycle repeats.\nWhat bothers me the most is that my family is expecting a lot from me and they can't seem to understand that I'm struggling because they care more about social status so they can't grasp the idea of me truly struggling mentally, literally nothing makes me happy anymore and I'm just faking it for the sake of people around me and to \"not kill their mood\" the constant nagging, the yelling, the disappointed looks in their faces say it all and I'm left to deal with their emotions on top of mine, I don't feel okay at all and I have no idea what to do, I'm just living because I'm still alive atp, a wasted potential.\nSorry for being this long and thanks for reading this far. Anything could be a huge help.",

    "selftext": "Tomorrow I have an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss how I’m feeling on 50 mg of Pristiq + 10 mg of fluoxetine as I taper off Pristiq.\n\nI can’t keep living like this. I hate everyone, I hate my life, and I’m always angry. Therapy doesn’t work, and I’m transitioning from Pristiq to fluoxetine. I constantly feel like I want to die. Life feels so unfair, and I can’t see anything worth living for. I’m always obsessing over the most insignificant things and how bad they are. For example, today my father told me I shouldn’t have asked a neighbor for something because it was inappropriate, and I can’t stop thinking about how he could say that to me. I feel like he’s a terrible father, that he never loved me, and that he’s siding with a neighbor over me.\n\nI’ve tried antipsychotics like Latuda and Abilify, and while they helped a little, the side effects—like weight gain—were unbearable, especially I struggle with disordered eating. The main reason I’m switching from Pristiq to fluoxetine is that Pristiq isn’t fully working for me. But is this destructive mindset just a withdrawal symptom from Pristiq? I feel like I could start a fight with anyone at any moment. Honestly, this is hell.\n\nI was diagnosed with dysthymia by a very reputable psychiatrist and have seen many other specialists over the years. Still, I’ve often wondered if I might be undiagnosed bipolar. However, antipsychotics haven’t fully worked for me either. I don’t experience phases where I feel really good or highly functional—I might feel slightly better at times, but nothing extreme. Right now, I’ve been out of work for a year because my mind simply won’t let me function.\n\nOccasional rage and intrusive thoughts have always been present in my life, but these past few days, they’ve been unbearable. I’ve also always been a very obsessive person, and it feels like my mind gets stuck in cycles that I can’t break free from. It’s exhausting, and I can’t find any relief.",

Feels like my parents and my siblings hate me and want me to do something with my life already; i'm just a burden. Not only that i'm also very rude and bitter toward them because I don't know how to stop projecting. I used to be so nice and happy I was so social and friendly and now i'm just useless and horrible to be around, I hate myself but I don't know how to change myself, and if I do I hate that my family comments about it, \"just ignore it\" easier said than done. I don't go to therapy cause no money and my parents don't believe in it (they need a tremendous amount of it as well). Not to mention how long i've focused on my flaws I can't see anything good in myself anymore, we're all human I know we're supposed to be imperfect but i'm too imperfect it seems. \"you're just starting out life, it's full of so many fun experiences\" whatever man all i've had is horrible experiences and even if I had fun ones the horrible overshadows everything not to mention I can't remember a thing from my past years. I'd end it now but I have a dog who I think loves me a lot cause she follows me around and stuff so I gotta keep living for her then when she dies i'll end it, in the meantime i'm stuck here on this godforsaken planet suffering everyday of my life because I can't get myself together, be myself or do anything right. Not to mention my sibling stole literally the majority of my socks or the dryer ate them so now I have 4 pairs of socks to live with and if I ask what happened to them it's just denial and apparently no one took them even though I know they took my socks. This is really just venting now since I have no one else to do it to/no one else really cares or they get mad at my complaining and venting, overall I think I need to get out of this house and the people I live with i'm tired of them and I do feel bad for saying that cause they're my family but whew are they a lot (so am i). it just makes life miserable being so stuck and not being able to do anything about it, seriously if I didn't have a dog i'd end already, I just want to have peace and quiet in my life i'm so tired of people, I died a few times when I was younger but was revived at the hospital, my soul was already trying to escape since day 1, as bad as it sounds sometimes I wish I did escape",

    "selftext": "Hello. I am a college student, been there for 4-5 semesters, almost nineteen. I’m almost going to the university. I have a great loving family, a roof over my head, I can have moments of great joy, yet I feel like I am falling into an abyss. No matter what logic anyone or I throw at myself, it doesn’t matter. These last two years, I’ve noticed some alarming things. If I have a very big argument with either of my parents, I will scratch at myself to calm down. That way I don’t lash out and anger them even more. In those moments I don’t feel I will be listened to, I feel wronged, and I need an outlet to control my emotions. When I scratch, I feel relief. I feel satisfaction when I see the marks. I feel joy to have found such an effective way to calm down. Especially since on those occasions, I want to hurt the object of my anger. I just don’t feel like I can say anything back. They can say anything to me, but the moment I say the exact same thing, they will get upset. Not too long ago my dad told me to be quiet since I was annoying him, and he was getting angry. I shut up, but not in my mind. “Oh. You’re getting angry? You’re getting ANGRY?!” I scratched myself on my arms and neck behind him as we walked, making sure he didn’t notice, all to subside the engulfing rage I felt. Not long after that, I did a severe scratch on my neck in front of him that looked raw and red on my skin. My dad panicked and told me that it looked like assault. He told me he was not only worried about this behavior, but of what people would think when they saw it. I knew that I fucked up. I now brought him into this. At that moment I thought “I want to die. It would be better if I died.”\nThe few occasions when I opened up, I didn’t really feel better. Well on one of those occasions, my mom thought I was being insincere with her and threatened to kick me out unless I told her what was going on. So when I told her, I just felt raw. Exposed. Humiliated. Now I don’t even want to talk about what’s going on with me. Just last semester we argued and I had some of the worst few days of my life. I would start crying out of nowhere, one of those evenings I just wanted to lay in bed since I couldn’t bring myself to do anything else. I reached out to my friend once, but they’ve already comforted me once and I don’t want to be too overbearing. A friend is not a therapist. I don’t want to dump my issues on someone. I don’t know. I just feel glum a lot. I feel slightly guilty too. I have so much, why am I feeling this way? I just feel trapped in a dark abyss. No way out, and I don’t know how much worse it will get.\n I know logically I shouldn’t harm myself. Hell, I didn’t even know scratching myself was a form of self harm. I recently looked it up and realized it was, and many of the reasons for doing so aligned with my reasons for doing it. But when I do, it feels good. Not good, it still hurts, but I get a sense of relief from doing so. I feel satisfaction. I don’t even know if I want to stop. \n",

    "selftext": "I just want to preface that this post gets a bit heated at times.\n\nSo, I've been suffering from a very taboo OCD theme (undiagnosed) for the last two years, and during February of last year, I had a major crisis. I searched a bunch of things in the morning because of a compulsion, and the bad part is that I forgot to clear my search history. When I pull my phone out during my first class, I open Google and all those searches pop up. Displayed on my screen was \"am i a bad person?\" (bad person is a replacement for the actual word, which is far worse). I panicked and put my phone away immediately. If anyone EVER saw those searches without context, my life would be over immediately. All my friends would leave me and hate me, and I would be the school outcast. I was particularly worried about the people behind me, as my phone screen was likely visible to them.\n\nOne year later, I have a long list of people that I know hate me with a passion. I actively run away from others because I'm paranoid of people calling me out for abhorrent things I simply didn't do. I'm pretty sure nobody wants to talk to me, and one of the people I mentioned in particular always keeps giving me dirty looks. One day he was talking to the people next to me and he says \"what topic are you doing on the assignment? i'm doing mine on the death penalty\" I'm pretty sure he only said that so that I know he wants me dead. Additionally, today I heard him talk about someone being a creep. \n\nI've honestly had it with this piece of shit. You don't have the full context, yet you can't ever keep your mouth shut. You made my own personal mental struggles into a massive spectacle for everyone to see. You speak about me when I'm two feet away from you, I'm not fucking stupid. I hate hearing this loud asswipe's voice every day.\n\nThe problem is that if I try to explain my condition to him, he won't believe that I have OCD, and will probably ruin my life even more. I genuinely see no way that this can be solved other than him somehow leaving school permanently. To be honest, I have been guilty of avoiding him physically as well, out of anxiety. I also can't look him in the eye out of fear.\n\nWell, one positive is that he was probably the only one to see the search, so if I deny the rumours and convince everyone without explaining my condition, only he won't believe me, and even if he thinks I'm a horrible person, that's not the truth in the first place.\n\nOtherwise, how do I get out of this?\n\nTLDR: I have a taboo OCD theme, so I did some searches, someone at school saw those searches and is making it their life's work to kill my reputation",

I've never been good about taking my medication every day and tbh I don't think I've ever really felt the effects. I'm exercising an hour a day 6 days a week, eating healthier, engaging with my hobbies, and hanging out with friends. But it's all a bandaid. I think my depression mainly stems from the stress of school and I feel noticeably better on the weekends although I do feel a hum of anxiety on sunday as I head into another week of school. \n\nAlso please don't tell me to talk to whoever prescribed me the medication. It's an online pill mill company. I suppose I could talk to my primary care doctor but it's difficult to get ahold of them right now ",

I am someone who keeps their feelings and lets them boil up. I currently have an undiagnosed eating disorder. I have a fear of gaining weight. I feel guilty after I eat something, and I stop eating and turn to water to stop the hunger or sometimes I won’t eat anything at all. I think my brain has also been accustomed to it. Whenever I am hungry, I look at food and my brain automatically makes me believe that my eating the food I’ll throw up automatically or that I am full when I am not. I haven’t gone to making myself throw up on purpose, but am scared that I will. I can’t tell anyone about this, in my household a mental illness is viewed as the person being mentally crazy. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom full time along with my grandma. I see my dad regularly. I am in a situation where my mom is close to my ex boyfriend’s family. We broke up 2 years ago. The relationship was toxic. He would try to make me get to bed with him, and praised me for my body. He was jealous, in both aspects of my success and other guys including my friend. I developed my ED when I was with him weighing 102 pounds. My mom and grandma still praise him as a he didn’t do anything when they have seen the messages. My mom and grandma blame me for it, and make me feel useless compared to him.

(This has happened before but not on this scale) Like we have construction going on outside which is annoying normally but for some reason I registered the loud banging sound as bombs??\n\n So I of course was panicked but no one around me was reacting, Instead of taking this as a sign im overexaggerating things. I start questioning my reality, if me being in the exams is my actual reality or if the bombs are and I should be running out the exam hall.\n\nThen I started hearing another type of sound probably coming from the construction that I somehow take as my parents yelling at me, I think I flinched a lot at this, hyperventilating at this point, eyeing the door constantly, the only thing stopping me was I think just the tactile feeling of the pen in my hands. Safe to say my english exam isnt going to get the scores I hoped for lol!\n\nAnyway the experience was terrifying, idk what even caused it. I haven't told staff about it yet though as:  due to my faint memories about it Im still unsure if any of this actually happened, Ill forever be seen as a raving mad man, it could be just a one time thing, Its a thing I should just deal with and im being melodramatic rn.\n\nSo what do you think I should do? Tell staff about this? Is this really like how hallucinations work?? Or am I really just being overdramatic? \n\nThanks for reading this far btw, sorry for how long this turned out being!

    "selftext": "I’m going to start off by saying I don’t really know much about mental health so excuse if I sound dumb😅 I grew up in a family that made it seem like you’re faking it if you say you’re depressed and don’t believe in managing with medication. I’ve been on my own for about 2 years now and have started going to the doctor for the first time in 7 years. I decided to go to a psychiatrist because of some issues I just can’t take anymore. I was diagnosed with OCD which kinda confused me as I don’t know too much about it. I haven’t been able to get more than 3-6 hours of sleep for two years. My brain won’t shut off and I have racing thoughts about things I need to get done that are stressing me out or scenarios that could happen, concerns about my brother and his family, concerns about my future, my dog, past experiences that I read into and wonder what they’re emotions towards me we’re. I am so tired but just can’t sleep. I’ve tried lots of things except prescription meds because I wanted to get the source. It’s takes me about 3 days of no sleep for me to randomly be sitting on the couch or in a chair and I’ll wake up to my Partner saying \"you were asleep like that for 3 hours\". If I clean for long hours, basically exhausting myself, I’m able to lay down and sleep for about 6 hours but I wake up on the hour with my heart beating like I’m anxious. I feel like most the time I have no personality or purpose and nothing brings me joy. Then I randomly get these bursts of energy like I can’t sit still have to clean or run and there a million thoughts going through my head and I feel like I could be some big shot CEO and build a house 😂 something my partner pointing out was that if someone says something or something happens that give some even the slightest negative emotion I just spiral and start thinking about how hopeless I am. I am so mentally exhausted and the only thing that keeps me going is that I have to be here for my partner and my pup dog. I repeat to myself that I just need to bite my tongue and wait this out until I have burst of energy and happiness again. I am also very organized. Not in the head, that’s all over the place 😂😅 but my room is spotless and precise and I can’t live without my multiple notebooks that I write lists for everything in/journaling. I’ll write a list of things to do when I’m hyper and then feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated after that hyper feeling goes away. I’m only a little bothered with germs, I don’t let my partner kiss the top of my hand, touch my face, or I’ll clean his cup really well so there’s no germs on it. I’m just worried that he might get sick. I definitely get really anxious over talking to people but as soon as I do I become this charismatic person that knows how to ask the right questions and keep the person talking about themselves to make them like me even though I find talking to people kind of unbearable:/ I apologize that this is so long and I appreciate anyone who reads this or even makes it this far. I’m also Sorry it’s all over the place 😅 This is my first time being diagnosed with anything/seeking help. My family never hugs or says I love you so talking about emotions feels wrong and I’m nervous about this whole process. I’ve been prescribed Fluvoxamine and have a follow up in a month so we’ll see how it goes!",

    "selftext": "I’m 19 and I’ve never learned how to swim. I don’t think I ever will. Sometimes I want to go on cruises, go to water parks, visit beaches, or hang out at the pool. I’ve always been scared of water for many reasons, mostly because I can’t swim, but it’s also because of what my family did to me as a kid.\n\nAs a kid on summer break, my family would set up those large inflatable pools in the backyard, the ones that were so cheap they’d have to be re-inflated in an hour, and we’d put the pool noodles and floaties in there. We’d climb the ladder, test the water temp with our toes. It was fun. My brother and I would play pool games like Marco Polo. We also played this game we called “whirlpool”where we’d run around the pool as fast as we could in a circle and try to make a whirlpool. Until one day, all the water exploded out of the pool. I fell over on the edge and inhaled so much water. After that, I was scared of playing the whirlpool game.\n\nBut what was really scary was Marco Polo. I hated that game so much. I haven’t played it in so long that I don’t even remember the rules, but all I remember is having to keep my eyes closed. I didn’t like it because I was scared I’d trip and couldn’t see where I was going. I was also scared of when it was my brother’s turn to close his eyes. He’d call out and I’d respond and he’d chase me. And when he caught me, he’d try to drown me. I don’t think that’s how the game was supposed to be played.\n\nThat game wasn’t the first time I was drowned. My dad would try to drown me too. He thought it was funny for some reason. He’d try to drown me at the beach and in the pool, and I don’t get it. I don’t get why I’ve been drowned a lot as a kid, I don’t get why it was so funny. He would tell me it was so I could learn to swim and breathe underwater, but the whole time he was laughing. He’d laugh when I cried and he’d laugh when I was angry with him and ignored him.\n\nBecause of how he acted, my brother and my cousins would do it too, because it was funny somehow. I don’t hold any grudges against my cousins or my sibling—honestly, they were kids following what the adult did, and they’ve all apologized to me for what they did. My dad has never bothered to apologize, and he probably doesn’t even remember.\n\nAnd now, because of him, I don’t trust anyone in the pool. I always hold onto the edge and stay in the shallow end. When I was younger all the kids would call me a loser and a coward, but honestly, I’d rather be a loser and a coward than be drowned again. Now, as an adult, I can know someone all my life and trust them fully, but once we enter a pool, they become the least trustworthy person in that moment. I won’t let anyone touch me, and if you come near me, I’ll freak out so much I might end up tripping and accidentally drowning myself, honestly, because I’m that clumsy.\n\nI also can’t dunk my head underwater, and sometimes it’s hard to even wet my face in the goddamn sink. I’ve tried to get over this fear so many times, and it’s really hard because every time I try, someone makes it worse—either by splashing water in my face, like so much water that I can’t gasp for breath, or by holding me underwater while I’m trying to get over my fear. I don’t understand what’s wrong with these people??? It’s baffling.\n\nAnyways, I don’t know why I made this post, I just needed to get this out somewhere.",

I've been struggling for YEARS with debilitating depression and have been through some trauma with emotionally unavailable parents and my ex. Last year, during the summer, my mom decided to let me try an edible. Although my first experience with a 20mg was quite terrifying, it didn't scare me into never doing it again.\nOver time I decided that I really liked taking them after doing them with friends at a sleepover and eventually building up a tolerance to them. They relieved all of my pain (physical and mental), helped me eat without feeling nauseous, made my insomnia go away for awhile, helped me paint and draw and just express creativity (I really love making art but never have the motivation to do it), helped me be happy, social, and just overall made me feel so much better. It was a godsend. \nI started stealing some of my mom's edibles as that was the only way I could get them. I did this for about 6 months and got high every night (responsibly). Recently, my mom found out I've been taking them (mind you, I know this is wrong but I never took more than I needed) and she hid them. I no longer have access to them and have been having an influx of suicidal thoughts as my depressive emotions just increased tenfold. I feel so lost and have been taking to D.P.H, m*rphine, ibuprofen, alc*hol, n*cotine, and other things just to cope with this. \nOn top of this, my friends all left me because they got boyfriends. Including who I thought was my best friend for 7+ years, she just decided I wasn't good enough for her. I also keep in contact with my ex (who cheated on me, but I still love him even though he has a girlfriend, I know this is toxic and bad but I can't control how I feel). My parents are also talking about a divorce as they hate each other, and I'm failing school and I just want to graduate. I'm so stressed and have no way to cope other than SH and otc drugs I shouldn't be taking.\nWhat do I do from here?",

Im scared to even leave the house with the fear of crapping myself that's how bad it is. I feel discusting and inhuman and am constantly missing out on events because of my fear and symptoms. I have so much anxiety abt getting sick in public and I even missed my own graduation. I feel so left out of life and think its not gonna get better because its been 2 years. The only things i can eat that dont make me instantly ill is rice and oatmeal, the plainest foods.Anything else with any flavour and i end up in the bathroom all day so i no longer eat normal food.  I cant go out to any dinner parties or eat at any resturaunt. i basically h ave no more social life and stay home all the time. Ive thought about ending it many times but cant seem to do it. How can I stay alive but be happy, have no more hope pls send any thoughts. I want my life back and to go back to normal.",

    "selftext": "Sorry this is long. I can’t talk to my family or friends about this because I don’t want them to think my wife is crazy. I currently don’t have a therapist as I was forced to relocate across the country and I’m now out of network and out of state for my therapist. I thought I would try to get some feedback from here. \n\nMy wife and I have been married for 14 years. Throughout our relationship she has gone through bouts of paranoia. For example, feeling like she’s being followed or watched, feeling like our neighbors are “in on it” (it being the government/military exerting mind control), feeling like people who used to be our friends/loved ones have ill intentions. I would try to help her cycle through this, and ultimately she would come to the other side not necessarily believing that all of it wasn’t true but at least not hyper-fixating on it. A couple of months ago, she started getting suspicious of me, which was new. I found myself having to prove that I was human, that I wasn’t a government agent, and that I wasn’t trying to harm her. This shift initiated out of nowhere, but had been steadily escalating. She dropped out of school, stopped talking to all of her friends and instead wanted to focus on finding the “truth”. Eventually, she told me that I had to leave because I was keeping her from her purpose (and her purpose was to expose everything). I voiced my concern about her mental health and suggested finding her own personal therapist where she can talk about her concerns about me (we had a couple’s therapist at that point), and she refused saying she wasn’t crazy. Since then I moved in with my parents across the country, and occasionally I’ll get phone calls where she oscillates between being mad at me for working for “them” or is sad and sobbing that my soul is almost gone. It’s heartbreaking because she’s clearly struggling but there’s no way I can help her. She’s clearly escalating and has no kind of support since she cut everybody off. As her wife, I could involuntarily commit her (5150) so she can get treatment but she’s been involuntarily committed before (she came out of a month long stay at an in patient military mental health hospital and was doing out patient therapy at a different mental health facility and there was a misunderstanding) and it was incredibly traumatic. I don’t want her to ever have to experience that again, but she’s seriously losing touch with reality. \n\nAgain, I’m sorry this is so long, but any direction would be helpful. I’m so lost. Even though she thinks I’m the enemy, I can’t just leave her for good without knowing I tried everything.",

I’ve struggled with feeling real empathy or remorse towards things for a while, I don’t completely NOT feel it, I do feel things like guilt and remorse and empathy sometimes, but hardly. I don’t not feel emotions, in fact I tend to experience emotions strongly, like either all or nothing if that makes sense.\nHowever, in many cases, when apologizing to someone or providing comfort I know im not being truthful. I have to put on a mask almost, and act as if I’m really sorry for a situation someone else is in. Sometimes I’ll feel bad for something that I have caused, but that’s mainly centered around how what I have done would affect me. I do not really feel for other people at all. A lot of my friends come to me for comfort, and I do my best to comfort them not because I feel bad but because it feels like what I am required to do as a friend. Which I’m not against. Many things I do, like a casual “oh I’m sorry” to something or comforting, just feels like habits I’ve had to learn to fit easier into society if that makes sense. I do enjoy being close to people, I value things like that.\n\nI get extremely angry and irritated very easily, but maybe that’s just a hormone thing. I haven’t really been physically violent with people before, I don’t think I’m that irresponsible or impulsive. I’d like to say I’m more calculated with the things I do. I’d like to say strategic? I think of stuff as a game. Where I just have to make all the right moves, be smart, and people will once again be by my side.

I can do that fine, but to actually think a sentence or like cognitively, consciously just work it out is next to impossible for me. \n\nSo the crux of my issue is that I have noticed that I have these very limerence based relationships or even pure fantasies and crushes that “talk” my thoughts and feelings and issues out in my head with all day.

I develop ideas about what they would think about my opinion and judge myself based on an idea of someone else’s idea of me. I know it’s not healthy and I don’t know what the solution could be. I’m just starting to put this together and don’t really know what to think of the realization. Also, I do have dyslexia and am pretty sure I have ADHD. Does anyone else do this?

I have never dated a guy before so Idk how relationship works. He was my first relationship, my first kiss. \n\n13th December 2022\n\nI got this gut feeling he is cheating on me. I confromted him about this and he accepted that yes he is cheating on me with his best friend. I was so attached to him that I gave him another chance and clearly I said if this happens again I will leave. We then started working on ourselves and had great relationship. We were about to go to same college also but he got into a better branch in different college so I told him to go in that college and make his career. This is the best thing I ever did.\n\nHis college was half an hour away from mine but he was a day scholar and travelled 4 hours everyday to college. After 1 month of long distance he asked me to have sex with him (after 1.5 years of our relationship) and I clearly said no. He started manipulating and getting angry about me saying no to it. I was soooo attached to him and I didn't want to leave him at any cost but I cannot go against my ideologies.\n\n6th November 2023\n\nSo one day he called me in his friend's flat saying that we will have fun, watch movie and chill. He assured me that we will not have sex. But that was my biggest mistake of going there. When I reached there I knew that he just wants to have sex nothing else. I clearly said no and I still remember him kicking with all the force I can. My wrist got a mark which stayed for 2 weeks. After that incident I stopped sexting and just changed the topic. \n\nDecember 2023 - Feb 2024\n\nI got this feeling that he is cheating on me AGAIN. He stopped spending time with me and not paying attention to me. I even told him to breakup with me but he kept manipulating, lying and make me stay with him. He made fun of me even about my pu\\*\\*\\* color. He made me feel so insecure, compared me with other girls.\n\n25th April 2024\n\nI recieve a text from him \"We are over\". I called him immediately and I heard a girl's voice from behind \"You are cheating on me with this girl.\" I was devastated. When you are in abusive relationship you don't realise it what is happening after you get out of you then it hits hard. My self worth, respect everything was in question. \n\nAfter that incident I started relationship hopping. But then one day I felt I need to stop but I needed a good sexual experience otherwise this will haunt me all my life.\n\n24th December 2024\n\nI met someone online and we were great friends. I talked about my experience and he wanted everything casual only so I accepted to have sex with him. Oh my my it was such a good experience First time I felt pleasure, comfortable yes it was just one time everything casual but after we did everything I had tears in my eyes, happy tears. He said \"Your body is releasing stress through your tears and it's healthy\". We never did it again nor I am planning to have sex. I never ever feel guilty or regret this experience but sometime I overthink \"did I do something wrong?\". It was against my morals and ideologies but was it my fault?\n\nI have stopped relationship hopping and became more stable but I have this thinking sometimes \"Was it my fault?\" \"Did I do something wrong?\"",

    "selftext": "I don't even know if this is the correct place to post this, but as the title says, I'm struggling pretty bad.\n\nI'll start from the beginning, at least what I think is the most relevant place to start.\n\nIt started during Covid when my best friend and I overdosed on what we thought were 30mg Percocet but turned out to be fentanyl. This happened on Christmas Day 2020. The next morning my roommate found us and called EMS but by the time they had gotten there, my best friend was dead, and I was barely alive. I spent 10 days in the hospital because I had aspirated while in the ambulance.\n\nI was so depressed because my best friend was taken from me, so I continued to snort these pills knowing what they had in the them. It was the only thing I could do to numb the pain. On top of that, I had immense survivor's guilt because he was sober for 5 years and I felt like I also took him away from his friends and family. After five months of snorting them daily, I had enough. So I had reached out to my family and they got me into a detox program.\n\nLeaving the program I felt pretty good, considering. I was sad still but I now had control over my life. I started feeling better every day and enrolled in a Software Development bootcamp through MIT. Shortly after enrolling I had a developed a fistula which became a recurring cyst near my butt. I was trying to study and would have to sit in weird positions at my desk to not be a fuck ton of pain. I got surgery for it but I think because of the way I was sitting for so long I developed sciatica. I still ended up graduating from the bootcamp and passed with 101%. Proud of that.\n\nMy doctor put me on pain pills for the sciatica, and this is what started the next hellish year of my life. Trying to get my insurance to approve different things felt impossible. But we did physical therapy (didn't help), acupuncture (kind of helped), tons of different medications (nothing helped). The pain pills is the only thing that gave me some relief. So I continued to take them for about a year until insurance finally approved me getting a microdiscectomy. They did a cat scan and saw that I had 2 herniated discs, so they went in there and basically cut off the part of the discs that were bulging.\n\nThis was in August of 2024. I got a job at a hotel and worked there a couple months. Had to quit because it was too much after having such a debilitating surgery.\n\nSo I quit the pills because I didn't really need them anymore (which i weened myself off of), ran out of anxiety meds, and also stopped vaping. The last month of my life has been miserable. I feel like my anxiety is worse than it's ever been, to the point where I'm feeling almost agoraphobic. And I've always been a very social person that loved being outside.\n\nI feel like it's 1 of 2 things, and I could be wrong. Either I was taking pain pills for so long it's almost like I'm having drawn out withdrawal symtoms that's causing me to suffer mentally because my neurotransmitters got so used to the opiates. Or it's that I've stopped so many different substances all at the same time that my body has kind of been dependent on, so I'm just repeatedly getting ran over by a truck.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences, if anyone has any, would be greatly appreciated <3\n\nPS. I'm a 32 year old male and filing for bankruptcy from all the debt I've accumulated over the last few years which could be adding to even more stress.",

I’m 32 now and I’m not sure if maturity has played its part but I have higher self esteem, I’m a bit more confident and just more at peace.

This has destroyed my self-esteem.\n\nI don't think I have real friends (maybe except for 1) to talk about my problems. The said \"ex\" basically took all of my attention away from my social life and I've been pushing away friends and family because I just wanted to talk to her. I regret doing that. And now she's left I don't have anyone else. Yes I can talk to family however I don't want them to worry about me, putting more things on their shoulders than what is necessary for them. I need to mend my friendships with people but I don't know how to fucking to do that. And I'm scared that if I do that, it'll make it worse.\n\n  \nI've been sleeping later as well which in the long run has very much fucked over my sleep schedule indefinitely (currently writing this at 2 am yay). If I keep continuing I'm scared that I will get some form of insomnia and I don't want that to happen. \n\nTDLR; I've been struggling with life and I've been having difficulty coping with the loss of people who I love  but never felt the same for me. I'm just overwhelmed.\n\nI would appreciate it if anyone has some sort of advice on this because I genuinely need it.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n ",

My mom got me on antidepressants in the third grade and since then I have gone from medication to medication my entire life trying to find what works best. Usually I can manage my anxiety and it is bearable, but lately it has been extremely hard and it’s the worst it’s ever been. I have been on lexapro for about 2 years, and that seemed to work fine. I struggled with obsessing over whether I had a brain tumor a year and a half ago, but after that I seemed to be doing ok. Towards the end of December I started getting anxiety nearly everyday, so I started Wellbutrin. It made me incredibly dizzy and very bad brain fog. So after two days of taking it I stopped. The past few days I haven’t taken it, I had some of the worst panic attacks of my life, so I went back on. Now I am so disoriented, dizzy, brain fog, and no capability of focusing on anything. I don’t know what to do and I need advice. Mental hospitals and out patient programs are out of the question as I have a full time job lined up and I’m in college. ",

    "selftext": "For context, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at the age of 11, but until a few years ago, I did not have a problem with people casually touching me. I work in the retail industry, and since 2017, I have adopted a no touch policy at work due to being assaulted multiple times. The first time it happened, I was aiding a woman who had requested help loading her purchases into her vehicle, and I was already past the time I would have normally gone to lunch. This woman had under 50 lbs of merchandise between all her bags, probably under 40 lbs, so I decided to load all her bags at once so I could go to lunch, she could get home and enjoy her purchases, and everyone would be happy. The woman yelled at me for picking up all the bags, and then slapped my arm and said, “Why did I hit you? You could have hurt your back!” I was absolutely stunned that she put her hands on me like that and immediately told my supervisor, who told my manager. Nothing was done about it, not a word was said to the woman, and I was very disappointed in management for not prioritizing my safety.\n\nThat was not the only time someone put their hands on me that year or the next two years, but that one incident was all it took for me to not want anyone, at least people I don’t know, to touch me at all. Until that happened, I did not notice how often people in my area just casually touch other people, but I noticed it happened quite a bit after that. Since management would not say anything to customers who put their hands on me, I started wearing buttons on my work vest that read, “Please don’t touch me I’m Autistic” and “PTSD It’s not all in our head”. By and large, people respect the buttons, but on occasions when strangers don’t pay attention to them, I pull back immediately if I can tell they are about to touch me, and if they manage to touch me, I’ll jump out of anxiety. I had an instance this morning when I was not wearing my vest because my work day had not started just yet, and someone who works where I work who I had not spoken with before touched me on the shoulder, and I jumped and immediately informed her of my wish to not be touched and that I wear buttons on my vest that say as much. If it’s someone I know well, I generally don’t have a problem with shaking their hand, or fist bumping, or even a hug, but if I don’t know the person, unless I am interacting with someone at a comic con or at an arcade, which are two places I feel are safe and where people share most of my passions, I find myself cringing at the thought of someone I don’t know touching me without consent. I even cringed once when someone touched me at a gas station when they realized they had come close to bumping into me. I have never been diagnosed with PTSD, or had a professional talk with me about it, but I am convinced that I have it since I have so much anxiety over strangers touching me. Based on what I have shared here, what are the chances that I have PTSD?",

I think the only reason I am still here is because it would hurt my father too much if I were to leave. It's not much of a way to live life when you are only here so you don't upset someone else.\n\nSpent 10 years as a line cook eventually rising through the ranks to be a chef of a restaurant making a 6 figure salary, which is quite rare in that industry. Albeit the salary came with 80-90hr work weeks that ended up burning me out. I left the industry 2 years ago and basically haven't done a thing since.\n\nWhether it be the industry I was in or just life in general I developed a serious drinking problem. I have essentially quit drinking now (maybe 2 drinks at dinner 1-2 times a month). But cutting the drinking and bar life our has has some side effects.\n\nFirst, I drank heavily in social situations because I have pretty crushing anxiety and due to stopping drinking I have essentially reclused from any sort of social activity other than through online gaming communities in which I have met some great people who I would consider real friends at this point. We talk daily not only about gaming but life in general.\n\nOn the note of gaming I have just switched addictions to competitive video gaming. This is something I have always been passionate about since I was a kid. Not just playing a game. I want to compete against other players with some sort of ranking system and climb it the best I can. Either be it through age or just skill I just am not good enough.\n\nI expect to win so therefore get very little joy out of it. I only experience misery when losing and am usually extremely mad at myself afterwards. I want to be the absolute best and can't accept when others are better than me. To the point of only experiencing either despair or pure rage with very little in-between.\n\nWhen reading any sort of similar posts about others who experience the same thing, usually the response is 'there will always be someone better than you'. While I know it is usually true, there are situations where someone is the best at something, whether it be a video game or sports. It doesn't make me feel better knowing that there will always be someone better than me. I just makes my hate myself for not being the best and making that statement not true.\n\nAnd now we come to the crux of the issue I'm struggling with. If I can't be the best because there is always someone better than me. Then I don't want to to live anymore. But striving to be the best and constantly failing is slowly tearing me apart mentally.\n\nI have actually started therapy for this issue and many others that I think are connected to this. But that is only once a week and in-between sessions I feel like I am barely holding it together mentally. I am having one of those moments now where I can't hold it together so I started reading and am not finding the answers I am looking for. They may not exist. So I just started writing.\n\nThere are people in the world who have way worse shit going on in their life than not being a pro gamer. While I can sit here introspectively feel a bit silly and embarrassed for letting something that to most people is probably petty effect me so much, it doesn't change the fact that it does.\n\nWhile quitting is the obvious solution. I'm afraid I will have nothing else to grasp on to to have a reason to live.\n\n",

I actually started to talk to her just to try to get her, and a day, we go out for a school trip and she decided to spend the whole day with me and she completely ignored her best friends to stay with me. Her attitude was the thing that convinced me that she was feeling the same for me (Spoiler, I was wrong 😑 ). Some weeks passed and we became really close friends and we talked every day at every hour basically, and after other things really strange happened, I felt that the the time to express my love came, there was just something in her eyes that made me feel special, I really saw something beautiful in that look. Anyway when I got the confidence to confess she said that she wasn’t ready for a relationship, at the start I didn’t even knew how to feel, but then summer came in and she started not responding back, and then I got really angry with myself, and then school started again and 3 days before school starts she messaged me to seek help with the homeworks… then when school started she was like 10 times more friendly than before, I tired again after a few weeks but this time she friendzoned me really clearly (“I see you just as a friend, nothing more, I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same way”). Now to the present, she continues to have strange attitudes with me that doesn’t have with anyone else and actually I can’t take her off my mind, it’s my first thought in the morning and my last thought when I fall asleep, her best friend (a girl) and I are really good friends and she’s the only person who knows how I feel, the other day I was talking to this friend about her and suddenly I had a panic attack, I couldn’t move and then I started crying and sobbing really really hard until I fell asleep, that wasn’t the first time that happened and probably will not be the last, and anyway, it’s really hard for me to be her best friend and I can’t continue in this way, sometimes tears start to fill my eyes when I’m talking to her, what can I do??\n\nMe: M15, Her: F14",

    "selftext": "Hello all, my great grandfather “Pepa” died 11 years before I was born. My father painted him as somewhat of a war hero. He was born to Germans in Czech Republic, being drafted into the German army through his blood. He ended up having an “accident” which led him to be discharged and he immidietly began helping Czech partisans. At some point, he changed his surname to sound more Czech  (probably before the war), and he was married to a Czech woman. After the war, he refused to speak German, only using his mother tongue to speak to his closest friend whose history with the war was almost the same as his. \n\nMy dad keeps telling me how much Pepa would have loved me because we’re apparently the same level of weird, engaging in deep conversations and whatnot. Apparently, I seem to have inherited quite a few of his characteristics and I’m really happy that I look similar to him when he was young. I truly idealise this person and I wish I could have met him. \n\nMy own granddad (Pepa’s daughter’s husband), is a terrible person and it makes me sad that I inherited his surname instead of my great grandfather’s. I have even spoken to my partner about this, asking if we could double barrel our surnames, changing my side to Pepa’s surname instead of the one’s who’s caused me so much pain growing up. \n\nIt causes me a lot of sadness looking at photos and wondering what he would tell me, what advice Pepa would share when I’m troubled, and what he’d say about my appearance (coloured hair, piercings and that. He’d probably hate it but I’m sure he’d love me more than his son in law ever has). \n\nThis is very convoluted. \n\nTLDR; I never met my great grandfather but he seemed awesome. I’m sad I never got to meet him and I somewhat grieve for his death, often wondering what it’d be like if he was in my life. It’s probably an unhealthy idealisation. Has anyone else experienced this?

I am 18F, and a college freshman in my second semester.\n\nI’m not very sure where to start…\nI have had brain fog (at least, that’s what I think it is) for the past 3 years. I’m not sure what it could be, or how I can fix it, but I am starting to get very worried for myself and my future.\nI am taking a calculus class (and accounting) and it seems like I have lost my ability to even do basic math. When I read a word problem, I have to read it 100x to register the words, and even then I have no idea what the question is asking me or where to start. What if I fail my classes? I can’t even sit down and study without involuntarily drifting and staring off into space for 15 minutes at a time.\nI don’t even know what I want to do with myself in the future, and I have honestly thought that I don’t even want to be alive anymore. I can’t, nor do i want to do anything. I don’t want to move forward in life. It feels like i’m doing everything that I don’t want to do. I feel useless. \n\nMy sleep pattern is a bit irregular. I hate sleeping and taking naps, as whenever I wake up from them i’m hit with a bout of depression and I think, “I don’t want to face the day today / why did I wake up / i would rather be anywhere else right now.”\nOn school days, I try to sleep 11PM-12AM, because I usually wake up at 8 AM - 9 AM. I don’t think this is too bad.\nOn non school days, I sleep 3 AM - 4 AM. I’m usually up on my phone. But then I wake up at 10 AM - 12 PM. So i don’t think i’m losing any sleep…?\n\nI eat one meal a day + snacks when I feel like it, and I take multivitamins (sometimes I forget.) I am 5’6 and 100-105 LBS. I don’t get hungry very often and sometimes I don’t even feel like going to get food, and I also have body image issues so i’d rather not eat too much anyways. I have had blood work done and my doctor told me that everything was fine, but I was put on iron pills because my iron level was a little low. So I don’t think there is any medical problem present? Aside from occasional heart palpitations and shortness of breath (which I have an inhaler for) there’s nothing. Yet i’m still so physically weak. I can’t even knock on doors without being in pain, and I can’t stand up for more than 5 minutes without feeling like i’m about to pass out. [unrelated but I am seeing a school counselor so I can get help with potential BPD diagnosis. This is complex and a long story, but the mood issues also get to me.]\n\nAll in all, i am very depressed. I feel stupid, and have no desire to do anything. What should I do? please ask me anything else if you need more information.",

    "selftext": "This is my first ever Reddit post, so please bear with me. \n\nSome insight, I’m a 25y/o mom of 3 (the oldest being 5 and youngest being 10 months) and my entire life was built up on trauma and unfortunate events; including being in an extremely abusive relationship from 17 to 22. I do suffer with mental disorders like bipolar 1 & 2 and border personality disorder (to name a few) as well. All this being said: \n\nMy insecurities are building up this pent up unwarranted rage towards anything I deem “too cool” for me to try or do. This includes things I’ve been wanting to do since I was a child. And I don’t know what to do.. \n\nFor 2 years now I’ve been in a great relationship to a man who sees my first two equivalent to his own; a healthy relationship in all forms of the word. So this is what makes me extremely pissed off towards myself for being this way. \n\nWhen we met, I was at my ‘peak’. I was in shape, the skinniest I’ve ever been (for someone with an unhealthy relationship with food, this was HUGE), and therefore I was happy with myself. If I had a bad day? Hey, at least I look good! And then I got pregnant with our son…gained 100lbs…and my mind just shifted dramatically. Although I’m aware of it, I just can’t fucking stop. \n\nAn example? When I was ‘skinny’ I was embracing my singing and truly practicing to audition for The Voice, but now I see myself as, “too fat and pathetic, a fucking joke of a human that’ll look retarded when singing”. So I don’t do it. \n\nI was an avid roller skater. Having dreams of getting CIB blocks to break in at the skate park, now I give myself the same ‘pep talk’. \n\nAnd this even goes as far as future planning with my Fiancé…he wants to make future plans for us, but I’m too busy in my head ‘knowing’ I’m too pathetic and embarrassing for him to want to do any of that stuff with me. (He’s a surfer and wants to teach me how to surf, but I stop myself because I believe I’m just a fat pathetic waste. He would like to go to a music festival/burning man/rave together, but I am too convinced that if we go he will realize how much of a loser I am and leave me for someone else..) \n\nWhether it’s going for a family walk in the neighborhood, hitting up the beach, a nice hike…whatever really- I somehow find a way to convince myself that I’m the last person my fiancé (let alone anyone) would want to be around. \n\nThis is how far I’ve allowed my mind to get me.. and I don’t know what to do anymore. He knows of my struggles and trauma and is extremely supportive of my healing journey..so I feel like utter shit knowing I am thinking this way, knowing it is near impossible for me to believe a single reassurance from anyone. \n\nI understand this post is a complete mental health issue. I would just like to hear if someone else can relate? If I can get some pointers on how to better my perception of myself? (God that sounds awful) ",

Instead of earning their respect, I became an easy target for bullying and ridicule.\n\nI constantly compare myself to someone I’ll call “A.” He seems to have everything I lack—height, looks, confidence, and popularity. Even in soccer, where I know I’m skilled, he gets all the attention. No matter how hard I try, I feel like I’ll never measure up, and it’s exhausting.\n\nThe leaked “hottest boys” list was a breaking point for me. Over ten girls contributed to it, and “A” was, of course, on the list. I wasn’t. It wasn’t just about the list but what it represented—confirmation that I’m invisible and unworthy. To make it worse, the girl I liked recently got a boyfriend, and it wasn’t me. My friends have even drifted away, choosing “A” over me, like everyone else seems to.\n\nMy insecurities have grown unbearable. My height, weight, and nasal polyps make me feel ashamed of my appearance and even my body. I’ve stopped playing soccer with my friends because I’m too embarrassed to mouth-breathe while running. Everywhere I turn, I’m reminded of how much I’m failing.\n\nI feel like a shadow—overlooked, unappreciated, and left behind. The hope I once had is gone, replaced by a deep sense of failure and pain. All I want is for someone to see me, to tell me I matter, and to feel like I’m enough. But right now, I feel lost and don’t know how much more I can take.",

The program for my major at my university is incredibly easy, no joke, yet I am failing basically everything, it's embarrassing.\n\nI didn't study hard in highschool because I have had this view on life since I was super young. My parents don't own a home and we're on eggshells with our landlord so even if I abandon this uni and study really hard to retake certain exams and get into something I'd be more interested in I still wouldn't be able to focus properly.\n\nA few mornings ago I woke up with the realisation that I am simply lazy and incapable. I've never been a hardworker, I've never been a good student or anything like that like my friends and other people ik. I am the spit image of my jobless parents. I feel this \"poor kid guilt\" as I call it since kids in my position tend to come out as these A+ students and achieve great things and then there's me... I'm like 2 steps away from falling on the other end of the spectrum and becoming a druggie. \n\nI feel like whatever I attempt at I'll just fail it. I'm starting to hate the things I even remotely considered could be better choices for me. I fear any job path I choose will just lead me down to an underpaid office job. I've no safety net to fall on and that scares me. For all I know I could be homeless in the next 6 months.\n\nIn my daydreams I'm often a physics professor at uni or a scientist or a great doctor but the truth is I highly doubt I've any skills it takes to become either. I've never excelled academically, and to become the first I'd need to excel in uni and, realistically, most of those people were quite smart from a young age. \n\nFor the latter, it's a almost a decade long commitment which contracts poorly in comparison to my life's instability. To even get into medschool I'd need perfect exam scores (in the 90%-100% range) to compensate for my less than ideal highschool GPA.\n\nThe only reason I even have those two in mind is the fact that teachers and doctors are the only two professions I'm semi-familiar with so it's easy to imagine and know what to expect. I think I'd enjoy them but they feel ridiculously distant, and I've started thinking about the major I'm in as a \"jackpot\" cos it's ridiculously easy for a degree that is considered \"difficult\" even though my engineering branch is considered easier in itself but still. \n\nI feel like everything would be fine if for once I was surrounded with safety and had a stable housing situation where my sole focus would be my studies, and I'd have my own space and peace yet reality couldn't be further from that. I'd like it to magically fall from the sky but I'm aware it's likely up to me to form it yet I've 0 resources for it. ",

I would leave in the afternoon and come back after sunset, playing with my bike. There was only one person I considered a friend; he would always sit in the street and watch me as I played, and I would talk to him and play with him. Sometimes, he would take me with him to the store, we would buy things, and then he would drive me around. I really considered him my first and only dear friend. \nAfter a while he told me \"Let's go to my house\" even though my parents warned me not to enter strangers' houses. But since I considered him my only friend, I went with him, and we played together. Instead of playing outside, we started to go to his house and spend time together. Time passed, and I would return home at 10 pm. \nWhen my parents asked, I would tell them I was playing with my new friend. The situation seemed normal, and they didn't ask for details, even though they didn't know who my friend was. \nAfter we got used to spending time at his house, he started showing me pornographic movies and videos. At first, I thought it was abuse, but he explained to me that they feel a nice sensation, and it's a feeling that no one can understand except for those who do it. He told me that the videos he showed me should be a secret between us because it's something nice, and no one else should know about it. So, I started going to his house every day to watch these films, not realizing that it was wrong.\n On the contrary, I thought it was something amazing, and I wanted to know more about it. For some strange reason, I stayed silent and didn't tell anyone about it, even though I was a child who couldn't stay quiet, not even about secrets. But I'm still surprised that I kept it hidden; did I know it was wrong? The situation progressed, and he started touching me in private areas, telling me I would feel the same sensation as in the film. I did feel it, and the situation continued until one day something went wrong between me and my friend. \nWe stayed in his house for two days without any movement from me, not even trying to go home. My thoughts were completely occupied with when this would end so I could go back home. There are many things I can't remember, and my mind doesn't want to recall them. After these two days, I don't remember anything that happened, I don't remember how I got home, and I don't remember that whole year. I remember small details, like being too shy to stay at my uncle's house because I used to wet myself while I was sleeping. I also remember the nightmares I still have to this day. \nI remember that I couldn't attend school that year, so I stayed home. Now I'm in the third year of middle school, and I should be in the second year of high school. What happened to me happened when I was 9 years old. This is the age when I reached puberty and was exposed to it for the first time. \nAfter all of this, I consider myself to have gotten over it, even though I can't talk about it in front of anyone, not even my family. But I see that I've overcome it as long as I can write it here, and I know that there are people who might read and care about my words.

She requires constant care, and though I want to be there for her, I often feel overwhelmed by my responsibilities. I also feel emotionally distant from her due to some difficult family dynamics, which makes it even harder.\n\nOn top of this, I’ve had to deal with the loss of my pets due to health issues, which added more grief on top of everything else. I feel like I’m constantly carrying a heavy burden, and I often feel like I’m failing in every area of my life, from my family to my studies.\n\nTo make matters more difficult, my relationship with my boyfriend has been a constant source of heartbreak. Despite how much I love him, he has repeatedly hurt me, and I often feel unsupported in my struggles. I find myself holding on to someone who doesn’t seem to understand my needs, which only adds to my emotional exhaustion.\n\nI’m trying to find ways to cope and get through each day, but I’m struggling to stay afloat. I wanted to reach out here to see if anyone has been through similar experiences or has any advice on managing grief and PTSD, especially while dealing with family stress, caregiving, and a relationship that’s causing constant emotional pain.

I use this \"two selves\" analogy not to insinuate me having a dual personality disorder or whatever, I'm using it only to paint a picture.\n\nI could also be described as \"trying to make too much sense of the magic\".\n\n\n\nI remember being very spontaneous in life, particularly in social situations. I've always been very well-liked with many friends and acquaintances. I know that I have the easiest time in the world getting to know and talking to random people, making people laugh, turning negatives into positives or funny things, and just naturally having a fun outlook in life. This isn't happening anymore, or at least I don't *feel* it happening.\n\n\n\nIt is like I have become aware of the magic. Everything that was once a natural process with no active thought has now become actively replicating what once happened naturally. Everything from how I talk, what I laugh to, how I sit and stand to how my voice sounds.\n\nWhen I meet a coworker randomly on the street I don't just say shit to them, I try to actively think about shit to say. When someone makes a joke, I don't react like I would naturally instead I actively think about how I should react. I don't just randomly get a feeling to message a friend, I actively have to make myself do it and think about what I (me, myself) WOULD write or WOULD say in conversations. Instead of being myself, I am actively *trying* to be myself, if that makes sense.\n\nI used to be very quick-witted, my mind felt fast and on point. Now it feels slow and dull. Like something is happening in there but it's muted and I can't quite feel it. Like a speaker with a big blanket on it.\n\nI don't really feel fun anymore, neither in myself or anything else. Talking to people used to be fucking super exciting but now it's on the verge of scary. Not because I have social anxiety but because of all of this.\n\nI don't know what happened really. I mean sure I started ADHD treatment but I've had pauses from the medication and I don't automatically switch back to what things were like before. I also take quite a small dosage.\n\nI sleep like shit and have done for the better part of last year. But I've had poor sleep habits before and nothing has affected my natural self in this profound way before.\n\nIts almost like I've become self-aware and now I am desperately trying to go back to not being aware but the more I try, the more I fail.\n\nI am curious what people have to say about my little write-up here, anyone with a similar experience who's overcome whatever this is? Any medication that helped? Any supplements or sleep advice that helped your brain sort this mess out? Please comment and let me know.\n\nEdit: I hope this doesn't come off as me bragging about how well I used to handle social situations, its just that I used to find enjoyment in it but now i don't so i guess my brain is trying to paint a fantastic picture of how things used to be and a shitty picture of how it is currently.",

All I want to do is leave and go home. I’m completely irrational, can’t eat, can hardly talk sometimes. I’m with a friend but I don’t think she understands and we’ve hardly had any time away from each other which has also been a struggle.\n\nI’ve been looking at flights but they’re just so expensive and I’m thinking I just need to stick it out these 10 days, but I also feel bad for my friend as she does get frustrated when I say I don’t want to go out etc. Any advice?

We always reach out for our phone, or pull out a laptop, or read... heck sometimes I feel the need to keep busy when I'm ALONE, otherwise I feel uncomfortable in my own skin and start fidgeting. And If it so happens that one person is actually not doing anything, it is seen as awkward, or at least that's the emotion I perceive when I am inactive around other people. Take public transport as an example: everyone sits down and immediately diverts their glance from each other or the space around them, and pulls out their phone. Most of those people clearly don't have the *need* to keep busy in that moment - and more likely than not they are just consuming entertainment and not actually being productive - yet they all put up the same act of appearing busy.\n\n  \nThe question rose in my head because I feel like I am not getting enough idle time, enough rest. This is because I share a room and feel this tension to be busy in the presence of my roommate.\n\nWhat is the cure to this manufactured need / social etiquette?",

He was in juvenile detention when he was younger and has struggled with behavioral issues ever since. My sister had him at 16 and, over the years, she’s faced her own challenges, often leaving him in the care of my parents. Unfortunately, he’s become extremely isolated—he doesn’t go out, lives off food stamps, and sells anything he can for money. He’ll randomly buy large amounts of food, stuff my mom’s fridge, and then leave it out to spoil. He spends most of his time indoors, often just sitting in silence wearing a mask and staring out. He doesn’t have a job and has even dismantled things in my parents’ home (like their old washer) to sell for scrap, despite being told not to.\n\nMy parents are at their wits’ end, and they’re planning to sell their condo and move out with my 7-year-old nephew, whom they’ve adopted. The elephant in the room is: what happens to my nephew when they leave?\n\nMy sister, who now has Section 8 housing, can’t have him live with her due to housing restrictions. She says she’s tried to help him set up therapy appointments, but he refuses. The truth is, we’re also afraid of him. He’s a big guy, kind of a gentle giant, but there’s an underlying fear that he could react unpredictably.\n\nI’ve always carried guilt over his situation, feeling like I could’ve done more to protect him when we were younger (we’re about 7 years apart). But now, it feels like no one knows what to do, and the whole family is avoiding it.\n\nIf anyone has experience with situations like this dealing with mental health, resistant adults, or just tough family dynamics I’d really appreciate any advice on how to help him and make sure he doesn’t end up in an even worse situation when my parents move.\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance or support.",

    "selftext": "(I'll put a trigger warning for people with who might have obsessive existential thoughts) For about a month now I’ve been so hyper aware of my thoughts and have been in an almost constant state of derealization and panic. All of a sudden I just became so conscious of my thoughts and more specifically how our brain functions and processes, HOW were able to think, WHY we think things, WHERE are our thoughts coming from, what makes our brain choose each thought. Whenever I have a thought, oberservation, or remark about something my brain now just hyper analyzes how it got there and wonders where it came from and it has just been utterly exhausting and I can no longer enjoy anything. Same thing goes for other people, whenever they say something funny or interesting I’m more fixated on how they came to that. I can’t think clearly anymore, I miss getting lost within my stream of thought. I miss thinking without thinking twice about what I’m thinking about. And before throughout my life Ive asked these type of questions plenty of times, like when I’m listening to a comedian or something I’d ask how they come up with their ideas for jokes and what not because they’d just be so absurd, but I never worried about it and would continue to enjoy whatever I was watching or listening to. I never thought to try to look any deeper into the inner mechanisms of our brain, I never worried about it, I subconsciously just accepted everything how it is. But now this is a big issue for my brain for some reason. I’m almost constantly worrying about what my next thought will be. I just want to get back to normal and think freely again.",

    "selftext": "Hi. I’m not really sure how to start this, but I’ve been carrying so much grief, frustration, and bitterness for years, and I feel like I can’t shake it. I’ve spent most of my life not feeling like a “full person,” stuck in a gaslit, trauma-brain cycle that’s made me question everything—myself, my rights, and how to live.\nI’ve spent so much energy trying to process what I don’t understand and going to therapy that went nowhere. I’d vent, spill my guts, and leave feeling drained, but nothing ever changed. Therapists said they were there to help me “reflect,” but I don’t think they ever showed me anything I didn’t already know. I’ve always been introspective, and all my processing has been on my own. Therapy left me burned out, bitter, and grieving the time, energy, and hope I wasted on something that was ultimately in vain.\n\nWhat I’ve Been Struggling With\n* Not Feeling Like a “Full Person”: I’ve spent years disconnected from myself and my body. It’s like living in a dissociative state where I’m not fully present in my life or my decisions. I’ve felt unsure of how to show up, what my rights and freedoms are, or how to just exist without overthinking everything. This disconnect has made it feel like I’m stuck watching my life happen without really participating in it.\n* Burnout and Grief: I’ve poured so much energy into overthinking, trying to fix things, and chasing clarity, only to feel more drained and bitter. I’m grieving the life I could’ve lived if I hadn’t been stuck in this cycle.\n* Feeling Misunderstood: As a neurodivergent man with ADHD and autism, I’ve been shamed for thinking differently and judged for just trying to exist. It feels like I’ve been villainized for being myself.\n* Exhaustion from Therapy: Years of therapy felt like venting into a void. Instead of clarity or progress, I was left more disconnected and bitter, knowing all that effort went nowhere.\n\nWhat I’m Looking For\nI want to hear from people who:\n* Have struggled with long-term grief, burnout, and disconnection.\n* Have felt like therapy was a waste of time that left them more exhausted than helped.\n* Have felt ostracized or misunderstood for being different or neurodivergent.\n* Are grieving lost time and opportunities they’ll never get back.\n* Feel stuck, unsure of how to let go of the past, and looking for ways to rebuild.\n\nIf this resonates with you, how did you move forward? How did you start living your life after feeling so lost and disconnected for so long? I’d love to hear your stories and find community and understanding that I’m not alone in this.\n",

I’ve always been mentally ill and that has pretty much corrupted everything in my life. We’re all just a bunch of lonely monkeys scrambling over eachother for resources, or trying to desperately to fill the holes in our soul. I think about dying all the time, but I have a family who I know would be devastated by my absence, so mostly I stay for them, I also have a tinge of hope that I’ll be happy one day, and I just need to hold on long enough for that to happen. Everywhere I look I see brokenness. People selling themselves and masking as this work persona at their jobs bc they’re desperate not to be homeless. Hateful transphobic people. Every time I scroll reddit I observe the epidemic of loneliness capitalism fosters. Every time I scroll instagram I see one more rich oligarch fucking over everybody else to fill their own emptiness, or the heartbreaking stories of what’s happening of Gaza where children are getting their legs blown off. We all pretend we’re fine but are we? Nobody even talks about how fucked up this society is. Not to mention we’re killing the planet bc we’re all too busy trying to survive in this broken meaningless system we’ve created. I lost everything to an episode of psychosis a year ago and my life feels really empty right now. People like to say they are mental health advocates, but the truth is they’re not. The thing about mental illness is that it’s complicated, and ugly, and people aren’t as compassionate as they think. We see a morbidly obese person and what do we do? We bully them ruthlessly, when in reality that’s what fucking depression and addiction looks like, and then they post a mental health awareness post on their fucking instagram, virtue signalling like they’re an advocate. But when it stares them in the face and it’s not this romantic idea the movies sell you, they recoil and they spit hatred.\nEverything has become about money. There’s way too fucking many of us. When I was younger I wanted to be a mother, but now that I understand the world I will never curse my children with existence here. Ignorance drives me insane, Trump a felon rapist is the fucking president. People are transphobic and want to ban abortion. Religion is essentially a mass psychosis bc nobody even knows what the fuck is going on or why we’re here and that dread gives rise to a desperate grasping for some fucking answer. Then those religious whackos try to enforce their whackness onto everybody else by outlawing abortion or suppressing queer people. Like we’re all just scrambling around playing house and screaming into the void, while some of us are drinking themselves to death bc they can’t stand it here either. \n\nI think about how much longer I have to endure this shit hole and I just can’t wait to die. I’m still young so theoretically I have a lot of years ahead of me, but I just want to not be here. It fucking sucks here man. I believe in reincarnation, and I have this hope that there are other planets with much more functional societies, and I just want to reincarnate anywhere else but earth. ",

    "selftext": "Hi friends. I’m struggling with a lot right now, and I’ve noticed a trend within the last few episodes I’ve been having. During these episodes, I’ve turned to self harm which is fairly normal to me. What is relatively new is that I’ve considered going to a hospital or urgent care, even though I was going to be fine unless my wounds got infected, which was unlikely.\n\nSo when is it time to actually go to the hospital? Is it only when you’re gushing blood or about to pull the trigger? I don’t know what’s considered “enough”, if that makes sense. I know my struggles are real, but that doesn’t mean it’s always appropriate to go somewhere about it.\n\nThe last episode I had, I ended up very lightheaded on my bathroom floor with cuts on every part of my body. Even then, I wasn’t sure if it was “appropriate” to go to an urgent care or hospital — because I knew that, even if I did pass out there, my wounds would close and I’d eventually wake up. Even if I desperately wanted to die, I knew that what I’d done wasn’t enough to be truly life threatening.\n\nDoes a mental health episode have to be life threatening in order to justify immediate care? I don’t know if something I’d done is life threatening until it’s too late.\n\nI don’t know!! I have been like this for over a decade now, and my perception of what is normal is completely twisted. I have no idea what the standard is here, and I’d appreciate some help with that.\n\nI’m fine right now, by the way. Not great by any means, just on the edge of an episode. Gonna go to bed early to combat that.\n\nThanks :)",

    "selftext": "My dad (66m), who I've been no contact with for over 3 years, died last Friday.\n\nI am 27,  live 3 states away, don't drive, and have a tight work and social life calendar. To go to his funeral would be inconveniencing a lot of people (including finding someone to drive me to the funeral),  missing multiple days of work, and time with the support network I've built outside my family. It is well known on both sides of my family that we did not get along. Yet, every single family member has been not so subtly telling me I need to go to this funeral. \n\nTo name a few things that my old therapist called formative traumatic events, that man was verbally abusive, and one time physically abusive to me. He cheated on my mom, kidnapped my brother (which led to a retaining order) when he was 12, and constantly fat-shamed me, including getting me a gym membership and forcing me to see a weight trainer twice a week when I was 10. He was neglectful, didn't pay child support, and as we got older only wanted to see us, my brother and I, on his terms and when it was beneficial to him. He also used money to \"convince us\" to spend time with him or hang out with him, sometimes hanging it and our \"inheritance\" over our heads to threaten us. (inheritance is in quotes because the man had no real money)\n\n  \nSo the point;  He is dead. I've had no contact with him for 3 years. My brother, who could stand him a little better then me is handling all his shit, and the funeral is next Friday. Everyone I know on both sides of the family is pressuring me, and guilting me into going. Saying I'm going to regret it and no matter how shitty he was he was still my dad. They have all made me feel like not going to this funeral would be a terrible mistake. They pitted him and they want me to pitty him too, to feel bad for the sad man who was just so lonely and out of touch with his emotions. He was a terrible man and being mentally ill does not cancel that out, I know that because I've worked so hard to improve myself. Yet, They have gotten in my head and now I'm sitting here thinking something is wrong with me. That I am some terrible sociopathic monster for listing the reasons this is inconvenient to me. \n\nI don't want to go. I don't want to take time out of my life multiple states away to go to some shit heads funeral. I have been more stressed and upset these last few days than I have been in a long time and it's not because he is dead it's because he is in my life again. Somehow he is winning by being relevant again in death. Every conversation is about this man, who for three years wasn't a factor in my life at all, and whose absence had radically improved my overall self-worth and mental health. I'm not seeing a therapist right now because I was doing so well on my mental health journey and my partner is not helping and I'm spiraling on this. \n\nShould I go? I'm an adult and I can make my own choices, but will I regret it? My emotions are muted and I honestly can't gauge how I'll feel if I don't. My family is toxic but should I be there for them? I just don't know. Am I rationalizing this too much, am I using my schedule as an excuse not to do something unpleasant? I don't know and I'm so messed up over this. Is it selfish to want to hang with my friends and go to my job and just not deal with the mess he left behind? Should I be there for my brother and the family and just suck it up and deal with the inconvenience of it all? \n\nPlease help.",

My family often makes fun of each other, and I was going to take a picture of my dad. He usually lets me take pictures of him, I just can't post any, but this time, he said no. I kept trying to take a picture of him because I'm a fucking asshole, and it was humiliating when my sister and mom said that he said no and that I should stop. Before, I didn't think it was serious, ya know? But I had to be told to stop. That never happens. I'm humiliated. I feel so fucking guilty. There was a lot of attention on me. I don't like attention. At all. My dad apologized for getting mad, and that made me feel even worse because why is he apologizing? I was the asshole. He has the right to be upset. Not me. I feel embarrassed that I'm actually sobbing about this. We both apologized, so it should be fine, right? It is fine for the rest of my family, but not for me. I feel so guilty. I constantly feel guilty, and my brain makes me think I did something extremely heinous. My brain always twists my actions into something horrible. I hate it. My guilt makes me want to kill myself, but wanting to kill myself makes me feel even more guilty. I know my family loves me a lot, and I can't do that to them. I hope someone just murders me. I can't handle the thought of my family thinking they were the reason I killed myself. I'd rather they hate someone else for my death. I can't stand the thought of anyone hating me. This is why I think I should just stop participating in things with other people. I always mess something up and I never learn my lesson. \n\nSorry if this is absolutely terrible writing. I am currently sobbing and I'm just typing whatever comes to my mind. Well, whatever. I'm gonna go now and sob some more. (I like saying sob)\n\nEdit: My dad just came into my room looking for a bigger travel bag(he's going to the big city tomorrow with my sister), I had one and gave it to him. He apologized for \"traumatizing\" me. I couldn't really say anything because I knew I would start crying again if I did. Now, I mostly just feel embarrassed. I feel like I made this situation a bigger deal than in was. I don't like my emotions. I can't control them. I don't like things that I can't control. Well, bye. I'm prolly gonna go read some Thanos/Nam-gyu fanfiction now and not show my face to my family until tomorrow.",

I am keeping many details vague to protect the friend's identity, but will provide information that could be relevant. I am nervous to post as I don't want the friend in question to find this post and assume that it relates to them, but I need help - I've exhausted all the resources I can find.\n\nThis friend has been experiencing delusions, EXTREME paranoia, and many classic mania symptoms (extreme happiness, spending absurd amounts of money, travelling on a whim, dropping in and out of contact, etc). They feel like they are doing the best they ever have been. In reality, they have lost all but two friends, they have become isolated from their family by picking fights, they are falling behind on bills, and are basing all of their financial decisions on nebulous business ideas that are \"sure to make them trillions of dollars\". They are CERTAIN that they are not suffering from any kind of mental issues, and the slightest suggestion that something may be wrong causes them to lash out aggressively at best, or cut the offender off forever without a second thought at worst.\n\nIt is clear to people that know this friend that they are very unwell. We have been trying for months to ever so gently and supportively push for visiting a doctor. There is some medical trauma that is complicating this, as well as the aforementioned hostility from the friend. We thought at first that this might be bipolar, as all the classic mania symptoms were presenting, and that the switch would occur after around 6 weeks. We could then be there to catch them, help them get back on their feet, and get them to a medical professional for proper treatment. However, the switch has yet to occur. The erratic and unsustainable lifestyle continues, alongside the delusions and paranoia. The support network for this friend has shrunk to myself and one other person, neither related by blood.\n\nIt seems to us that the friend desperately needs help, but we are at a loss for how to guide them towards it. They may well need to be in-patient for their mental health state to protect them and all those that they encounter, but we do not have the ability to start this process without family or a medical doctor being involved.\n\nHas anyone ever been in a similar situation before? What possible courses of action exist? We truly want the best for this person, and want them to be able to heal and be self sufficient. We are also aware that the situation is precarious, as we could be cut off forever for some arbitrary action we took or delusion thereof. Or the friend will wind up being arrested, and goodness knows that won't end well... Any help or ideas would be so very appreciated!!!",

And with the usual desk I set them on “only other option is literally the floor” full of random items and donuts, so I set the wheel hub on the toolbox next to their computer they use to order parts, “the tool box is about 10x6ft” and a random mechanic probably in his late late 40s comes up behind me and tells me to not set parts on “his toolbox” and as I was about to explain that I was trying to ask the other guy where to put them before he literally turned around and walked away from me. I couldn’t get the first two words out before he he interjected, and stood close to me and said “I don’t care, it’s my toolbox I set stuff on it because it’s mine, it’s worth over $15,000” which it’s literally an Amazon toolbox iv never even heard of, but that’s besides the point.

I live in USA, hopefully authorities are a little bit more attentive to the cause in other countries. \n\nHere, however, a few NGOs we have are old toothless watchdogs that can not even bark right anymore. NAMI is a joke. Suppose there are others, but the fact that we haven’t heard of them is indicative of their meaninglessness. Somehow, we must organize. There are those of us who know how to. I exhausted my resources, maybe others have some ideas.\n\nThe problem is, they don’t want to listen to us. But if we start with the right people, we might begin getting somewhere. First and foremost, we need a place of brick and mortar to go to when we are in distress. It has to be open 24/7 and offer quick stabilization program as well as ability to engage in artistic self expression and socialization. These places, at least one per major city, are not that hard to build. They will be expensive to run but will pay for themselves in human lives. Enough with telehealth charade.\n\nThere are other ways to improve mental healthcare, but this one is particularly enticing.\n\nTell me what you think.\n\nThank you very much.\n",

She's going to be devastated and absolutely ball her eyes out. I take 100 percent responsibility for everything. But telling her is going to be damn near impossible. But it needs to be done. \n\nAnyway, I don't want to drag this on. But any advice would be appreciated. I can explain more, however if that is acceptable. It's a long, long, long, batshit crazy story that doesn't even come close to anything I've ever heard from other drug addicts. \n\n.

Over last couple of years I tried to find it to no avail.   \n  \nMy first and only romantic relationship lasted 6 months after which we decided to split up due to our religious beliefs and her family being aholes that saw me as someone dangerous just because of me being big. The last day I saw her she also told me that she's asexual which of course I overthink even 1,5 years after the fact. Am I that unattractive I can only be in relationship with asexual people? Did my unattractiveness make her think this way? No idea.\n\nBefore that I had a big crush on this another girl named A. After some months of knowing each other she made out with my best friend who had a girlfriend at the time and knew I had a crush on A. It was the first time I experience physical heartache from something emotional.\n\nHalf a year ago I tried with a girl B that is in the same group in Uni as me. The first week was magical and then we slowly fell apart. She was probably never into me but I was into her until I realised how tiring she is to be around, just constant talk about anything.\n\nDuring that time there was girl C which I found attractive from the first time I saw her during summer. After getting to know her a bit over a course of last 5 months we became closer and I had some hopes that maybe she liked me back? I was always told making a girl laugh is more important than good looks. BUT WHAT DOES THAT CHANGE if theres a different guy that both makes her laugh and looks like a greek god. She doesn't know I'm into her, or maybe she does, I don't really try to hide it all that much, I just won't say it directly. That said there were a couple of instances where she told me she had a crush on some guy, then I saw that he looks like one of those \"sigma\" influencer 1%ers with a buzzcut. My hopes were shattered.\n\nThat was a week ago. I have now decided I need to make myself believe I don't need love. Even if it takes constant repeating \"you don't need love\" in my head. There's a lot of things I need to focus on right now. I have big goals for my life and I need to look at this lack of love as a good thing that I will save time on. I know it would all be easier If I lost some weight, hell it WAS easier when I was 20 kg down but I just F\\*\\*KING hate this society we live in where the looks of 0,01% top influencers dictate dating standards. I hate that when I look in the mirror and see something less than this 0,01% I instantly assume it's ugly and unlovable. I hate that I take good care of myself, I have good skincare, I shave regularly, I try to improve myself mentally but all of that gets thrown away because I don't have a sixpack. AND I HATE THAT all I just said is probably not true and only my overthinking and I hate my overthinking because for the last year of my life I didnt feel happiness despite having both loving parents, good education and food on my table. I just want all the thinking to stop. There's nothing I want more. I wish I knew a little less so I didn't know how much I don't know. And I wish I knew what teenage love is but those ears are far behind me and will never come back.\n\nYeah, I will probably talk to my mom tomorrow that I need a therapist ASAP because I feel like I'm going crazy and everything I've been feeling for past half a year, maybe 4 years I HAVE NO IDEA points to depression. I was also thinking of SH lately but I have no balls to go through with it which probably is a good thing.",

I’m not depressed because I can function normally and sometimes especially when I’m with my 3 siblings and mum who I’m super close with or my main group of friends I can have a really fun and good time.

(i never even mentioned suicide via firearms and don’t even know how a gun works). i tried getting the order vacated, but the judge concluded that i still pose a danger to myself. i am a prospective medical school applicant currently on a medical leave from school with a 4.000 GPA. i work as an emt and have been devastated that this order could impact future medical school admissions or employment opportunities. it is a civil court order that is supposedly sealed, but i am fixated on the fact that i now have a record all because i wanted help from a therapist. does anyone have any experience with this? thanks!

Individuals with autism may self-sabotage due to overwhelm, anxiety, or sensory overload, but this behavior is not intentional or manipulative. It’s typically rooted in a lack of understanding of social norms or fear of failure, not a desire to control or manipulate others. In contrast, covert narcissists self-sabotage to gain sympathy or attention, using passive-aggressive tactics to maintain their sense of superiority and secure validation. While autism-related self-sabotage is unintentional, covert narcissism is driven by emotional manipulation.

    "selftext": "Hello friends!\n\nIt's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.\n\nPolitical anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.\n\n**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:\n\n[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)\n\n[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)\n\n[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)\n\n**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.\n\n**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.\n\n**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or [send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fmentalhealth)\n\nStay safe out there!",

    "selftext": "Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.\n\n# What do the mods do?\n\nModerators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.\n\n# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?\n\nIf you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.\n\nIf this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)\n\n# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?\n\nMod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.\n\n# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?\n\nYes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.\n\nOur team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.\n\nIf you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.\n\nNo one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.\n\nSecond, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).\n\n# How do I apply?\n\nIf you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:\n\n1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:\n   * What does mental health mean to you?\n   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?\n   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?\n2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.\n3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.\n4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.\n\nThanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",

Telling me all kinds of nice things and that my family loves me very much 😭😭 we ended up hugging each other sobbing. After I collected myself in my car I decided to give it another shot just for her.

    "selftext": "I managed to evacuate from Gaza, leaving behind the rubble, the bodies, and the memories of the war zone. You’d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I’d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.\n\nI’m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things—traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t.\n\nEven after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.\n\nI’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it’s just blank.\n\nPeople think escaping the genocide means survival, but it’s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what’s still happening, or hear about others’ struggles, I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.\n\nI’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I’m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.\n\nIt’s been 5 months ",

They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can’t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911. My eyes hurt but I can’t sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head. I feel like my life is in pieces and I don’t know what to do. That’s all I can really say...\n\nIf you need help, please get it.

It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. \nIdk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",

I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I’d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn’t left my mattress for days. I wasn’t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can’t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me. And for an update on my mental, I am doing incredibly better. Don’t want to go too in depth because he deserves all the love on this post. Thank you for reading. ♥️",

    "selftext": "My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. \n\nI'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.\n\nI posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. \n\nThey fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. \n\nI'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.\n\nI feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.\n\nJust needed to vent, thanks for reading.",

I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. \n\nI’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. \n\nBut it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. \n\nI know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.\n\nMissing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours. \n\n\nTL:DR Life is hard, I like easy things.

It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._\n\nTLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day.

I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. \n\nWithin that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. \n\nFor two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. \n\nNow, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. \n\nTherapy saved me. But not my therapist. \n\nMy therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. \n\nThat’s not how it worked for me. \n\nA lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. \n\nThey think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. \n\nI did. \n\n(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.\n\nTherapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.\n\nI can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. \n\nI hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. \n\nP.S. I’m new to Reddit. And I like it a lot.

There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.\n\nBut now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.\n\nBut I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.\n\nOne thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.\n\nEveryone is different and take as much time you need to heal.\n\nFor me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.\n\nI am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.\n\nI am wishing you nothing but the best.

    "selftext": "13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.\n\nOf course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.\n\nBut Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.\n\nAnd worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”\n\nThis one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”\n\nYet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”\n\nI hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you for all of the heartfelt responses and experiences you have shared. I truly had started to believe I was in the minority with my critique of 13 Reasons Why. I’m glad to know there are others who share the same concerns.",

She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to add I know it is my mom's right to have sex.

Then he’d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he’d lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.\n\nWhen I got home, he’d be waiting for me. He’d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag’s supposed to go. Then we’d play fetch with toy balls and I’d give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he’d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.\n\nSince the pandemic started, I’ve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He’s been trying different tactics.

He still meows if I’m in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I’m on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he’s trying so hard.\n\nLiterally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat.

This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. \n\nThis guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting. \n\nI got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and I plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me. \n\nGod is real and he sent this man to save my life",

Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with.

If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this.

I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.\n\nI have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.\n\nSo how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.\n\nThat about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.\n\nNow I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.\n\nThat is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.\n\nThere is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind. I haven't had anyone say anything this nice to me in years and just reading through these comments is the single best thing I've experienced in a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 2. I am speechless. I've read every comment. Tried to respond to every chat, but I have to get back to bed for now. I just wanted to thank everyone again. All of you helped turn my birthday into an amazing and memorable experience. From the very bottom of my humbled heart, thank you.",

He died on impact, but the paramedics were able to resuscitate him. The guy driving ran away in the woods nearby. \n\nMy friend died 3 times before they finally pulled the plug. I hate to imagine the pain he was in. Everyone around me keeps mentioning him and I can’t handle it. We grew up together and now he’s gone. I went to a pawnshop nearby my school while i was waiting for my brother and i met the dad of one of my friends who was also really close to my friend who died.

    "selftext": "When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.\n\nI looked at him with disdain. \"Why are you crying?\" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. \n\nWhen I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn’t control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.\n\nI think I’m one of the millions of men out there who’ve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn’t show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.\n\nFor all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that’s even more manly than being a tough guy.\n\nThank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo\n\nListen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VzIeM6u2Zc",

Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  \n\nAlthough I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. \n\nMy anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.\n\nSo that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too.

    "selftext": "I saw someone on my friends list post about someone they knew who committed suicide being selfish and I am not in the mood to play around about this. Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone \"God doesn't make mistakes\", \"Suicide is a sin\", \"God only gives us what we can handle\", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses \"I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself\" or \"Other people have it worse\" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole. It is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy. Get off your fucking high horse.",

    "selftext": "Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that’s a good thing that I’m so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn’t always the case. \n\nTen years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn’t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of “sides” were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. \n\nI spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. \nMy entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn’t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. \n\nI graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.\n\n10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. \n\nRight now I’m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I’m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I’m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I’ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I’ve come.\n\nI still have a long way to go. I’m still a work in progress. I haven’t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. \n\nIf you’re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn’t something that people just say. It’s true). You’re not alone. You’re loved. And you’re stronger than you think.\nTake a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.\n\nTLDR - I’m 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone.",

    "selftext": "I did a random experiment on myself a few years ago. I did not read about this anywhere, I just thought of it and decided to try it.\n\n\nI forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger I see. When I see someone on the street, I think of something nice about that person. Like \"their hair look so good\", \"what a nice smile\", \"those legs are great\" etc. In the beginning it was hard. Like, the first thought that popped up was something mean, but then I followed it up to find something good about the person.\n\n\nIf I don't find anything nice to think about their appearances (it happens), I don't force it, instead I make a nice assumption about them. I think \"she probably has a great sense of humour\", \"he is probably a great dad\", \"this person could be very creative\" etc. Just whatever pops up, and the great part is, it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I just form a nice assumption in my mind. \n\n\nIn the beginning I had to consciously make the decision to think something nice. After a while it started automatically happen. It's been years, but now every time I go out I think mostly kind thoughts about people. This lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself. When I see myself in a mirror, I'm no longer trained to search for flaws, I automatically think nice things about myself aswell. I'm a much more confident person due to this.\n\n\nIf you want to try this, I recommend starting with strangers. When that becomes natural, apply it to everyone. Your classmates, your colleagues, your friends. Force yourself to focus on the positives. If you think something negative of someone, thats perfectly okay, but follow it up with something nice. Now I have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments, because that's how my mind works. I'm a lot happier and calmer around people when I think kind thoughts about everyone. And this is not something that happened naturally, I had to train myself to do this, and it worked!\n\nI want to add, that I've had some friends that were the opposite. The kind that thinks it's fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances. I talked to them about this, talked to them about how I'm changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me. Some changed, some I am no longer friends with. Not a big loss, in hindsight. People that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway. \n\n\nIf you try this, good luck, and please let me know how it goes for you :) It will probably feel super weird and silly in the beginning, but try to stick with it for a while and see what happens to your thought patterns!",

    "selftext": "If you're reading this can you please upvote it so others can see, thanks for reading this as well it just helps me I guess.\n\nMy names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.\n\nI was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.\n\nIt bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.\n\nI was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.\n\n2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.\n\nWe argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.\n\nIt broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.\n\nHOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.\n\nThis is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!\n\nSeptember hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.\n\nThen my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.\n\nEverything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.\n\nI started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.\n\nI started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. \n\nIn December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.\n\nI had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.\n\nStarted the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. \nJ and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. \n\nThroughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.\n\nBut... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.\n\nBut how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.\n\nI don't know if anyone will make it this far, but if you are, and if you are my age, thank you, I don't know what you really can reply with but please upvote as it just helps I guess my self esteem.",

    "title": "If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I’ve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.",
    "selftext": "First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it’s also when I am over tired or over worked.\n\nSecondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it’s scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren’t for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the “option” but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. \n\nI know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.\n\nLastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?\n\nYou have real problems. They suck, you’re totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn’t for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.\n\nFocus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don’t say “everybody hates me”. Say “everybody hates me when I ______”. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend “if you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific”.\n\nThere is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter’s graduation some day. Hell even if it’s just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that’s a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.\n\nDon’t hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We’re all on this crazy ride together.\n\nGod bless.\n\n(Also posted on r/male mental health)\n\nEdit:\nThank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words. \n\nI hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn’t delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn’t. Just because you haven’t attempted doesn’t make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else’s. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.\n\nMany of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.\n\nIF YOU ARE CONSIDERING SUICIDE PLEASE CALL THE SUICIDE HOTLINE.

    "selftext": "I'll start by saying, I'm agnostic. And I dont really believe in absolutes. Because no one can see the future. No one really knows whats happening in someone else's head. And you can't predict who will pull through whatever, or who will be lost to whatever. And there's no way to really know what happens when we die. \n\nIn all honesty, that thought brings me comfort. I dont think im a bad person. Sure, ive done shitty things, im human, like you (I assume). But this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit. \n\n2019 Is my worst year to date. August 24, a good friend who I really looked up to, committed suicide. I credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide. Then in November a great uncle and a high school classmate, both i was very fond of, passed within a couple days of each other. Then December 10, my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior. Her husband, my grandpa passed in May 2020. \n\nThat was a bad time, as you can imagine. I had never lost anyone I was ever close to before then. My friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today. But whenever I have a beer, or some liquor, I pour one out in his/their name. \n\nI like to imagine my friend in Valhalla. As of all the afterlives that I know of, thats where he belongs. As he is a fucking legend. He lost his battle with depression, but he fought fucking hard. I still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don't understand the rules of whatever afterlife Pathfinder game he's running. \n\nAnd I like to think that wherever he, my grandparents, my old high school buddy, and my great uncle may be. When I pour one out, a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them. \n\nWhich that thought is made better by the fact that often times, im drinking really shitty cheap booze. And they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda \"what the fuck? You pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer?\" \n\nI dont know, just a thought that may help someone in mourning. Hang in there, stranger. No matter how shitty life gets, it will always get better.  And despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point, it WILL get better again. \n\nHang in there.",

    "title": "New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!",
    "selftext": "I am so fucking excited.   \n\n\nStory time.   \n\n\nBefore Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  \n\n\nI lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   \n\n\nThings were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   \n\n\nWinter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   \n\n\nI started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   \nThen the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   \nI got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   \n\n\nI needed something drastic though.   \n\n\nSo, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWas going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   \n\n\nI was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   \n\n\nIts going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   \n\n\nBut huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   \n\n\nI wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   \n\n\nThings are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   \n\n\nForward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?",

I cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and I have breathing issues because Ive been smoking cigarettes, weed, heroin, pills, suboxone and tons of other crap since I was 12 years old. My breathing is so fucked I am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive. I have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus, which I basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face.\n\nIm not taking drugs anymore but I still smoke a cigarette every few days and I am so guilty because no matter how hard I seem to try, I cant even take care of myself. \n\nI live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work I wouldnt be able to move out. The only person I had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years. He was my best fucking friend, the only person my age that I had been friends with in 6 years. My other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if I show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life, he just thinks im weak. I stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence. but I end up visiting him every week because i want social contact, but I just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour.\n\nIve recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun. I have seizures when I dont get enough sleep, and I cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working. Literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm. So im constantly worried about having a siezure and I try so hard to get good sleep. So recently my sleeps been good enough that I dont think im at seizure risk, but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline. \n\nMy brother doesnt talk to me, hes becoming an alcoholic. I mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year, but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime I make eye contact with him anymore. \n\nI really dont want to kill myself but I have felt so bad my whole life and I cant seem to turn it around that I think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option. This is fucking bullshit. Why the fuck are the people around my happy. They are all fucking kidding themselves and need to just accept the fact there lives fucking suck so maybe they might actually do something to help themselves and inturn the people that care about them.\n\nI hate everyone I care about and it makes me so fucking angry. I cant ever express this anger to everyone I love thats hurting me because they just seem to treat me worse.",

It was clearly a tic, but Rachel’s reaction was to tell me I couldn’t talk to her that way. Her tone went from scared shitless to anger. That was when I knew that there is not going to be any help for me. At least not from a woman.  I realized then that I wasn’t going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone. To be honest, it kinda ramped up my paranoia also. \n\nBefore I got off the phone I calmed myself and quietly told her, “YOU are a mental health professional who has trained for this. When a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word YOU find offensive you need to remember that YOU’RE feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through. Please think about this because you’re hurting some people more than you’re helping them”. \n\n\nI am so angry about this. I did everything right. I know from experience how broken our mental health system is, but this really hits a new low.  I took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional, but frankly I’m worried I’ll get a woman on the line in HR and will again be dismissed because of sexism. From now on I will ask for and only speak with men when calling the Suicide Hotline(s).   \n\nOne thing I know for sure, I am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon. If the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it’s falling apart face to face. \n\nThank god I’m already so used to self-isolating.\n\nEDIT - \n\nThank you to everyone who reached out, I appreciate it. \n\nJust so this doesn’t head into finger-pointing territory I want to clarify a few things.  It’s easy to take from this that I’m taking my anger out on women. That’s fair and TBH I’ll acknowledge a lack of trust on my part. \n\nIf you wrote something supportive and/or helpful....thank you for hearing me. \n\nIf you wrote something that showed a lack of empathy.....that’s ok. You just didn’t hear me. I’m used to that.",

    "selftext": "When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. \n\n\nI had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. \n\n\nI knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. \n\n\nA few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. \n\n\nToday he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming. \n\n\nI spent years thinking I was weak, dangerous, crazy, and unreliable. But I'm not. I am sane. I am strong. I am dependable. I DO deserve the good life that I have.",

    "selftext": "Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?\n\nI’ve wondered this for years. I’ve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn’t breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn’t help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren’t going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some “mobile counselors” would be on the way.\n\nEventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These “mobile” counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.\n\nThat’s when I came up with this question. At that moment I would’ve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.\n\nHelplines, in my personal opinion, aren’t the same type of treatment. I’ve only tried a couple though, so I’m not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation. \n\nIn addition, if this concept could actually work, what would one have to do in order to be able to open such a place?",

    "selftext": "In my family we don’t talk much.\n\nTonight was a rough night. As per usual I was sat alone in my crying and melting into my mattress. When my mom came in I didn’t bother looking up at her and just growled a classic’ go away’ in response. \n\nShe asked to borrow one of my books and I peeled myself off my bed to grab it. It was only when I went to tell her to leave did I actually bother to look at her. She looked like she had blown her noise a few times and her eyes were watery. This was maybe the second or third time in my entire life I’d seen this happen and I forgot how shellshocking it was to see your numbed parent like that. \n\nThis lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay. We didn’t talk much. Instead I just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie. I got her a blanket and some tissues. The whole movie we just sat there, at first crying and just holding hands by the end.\n\nI still don’t know what happened to make her so sad. She knew better than to dig into my pile of mental issues. But when the movie was over she hugged me and said “thank you. this is the happiest I’ve been in a while. I needed this.” \n\nIt really took me out of my own bullshit for a moment to realize I had done something good just by being there. And she had done the same for me in a way. I could tell we just both felt cared for by the end and in my house that goes a long way. \n\nDon’t forget how powerful small things are. Or that the people around you are often suffering too. You don’t need to be in perfect or even good shape to be the support someone needs. \n\n\nAlso the movie was Hairspray if anyone was curious.",

    "selftext": "I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it’s been rough.\n\nThe pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn’t eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.\n\nI found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn’t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?\n\nThat night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I’m still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.\n\nAfter the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I’d heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.\n\nThey hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn’t suck. And I don’t suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.\n\nI know I’m going to feel shitty again, but it’s going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I’m really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I’m a hard worker and I’m no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?\n\nI guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there’s always a chance for it to get better. I’m moreso making this post to look back on the next time I’m suicidal, but I’m hoping my message will help others a little.\n\nThank you for reading :) you can do it❤️",

    "title": "For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.",
    "selftext": "\\*\\*\\* please read the edit \\*\\*\\*\n\nFor a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting.\n\nI was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up...\n\nThis woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me.\n\nI bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me.\n\n*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!*\n\nI clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it.\n\nShe convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there.\n\nShe took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question.\n\nThe worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming.\n\n*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!*\n\nAnd then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. \"What a bitch\"\n\nThat night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age!\n\nShe did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble.\n\nShe broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt.\n\nI'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having \"trouble\" but I never told her my side of the story.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being \"responsible\" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: I just need to say this, since this is getting some reads... Please please please if you just don't feel good - that doesn't necessarily mean sad or angry, it could just be \"out of it\" - try and find the reason for it. I've tried for years. I've been in therapy since I was 17, and I started cutting myself. I used to think it was because of guys, or because of my parents' divorce, or because of x and y and... I only realized what this was all about when I told my therapist that the last time I was truly happy was when I was 15. He made me write about every single year of my life, and we went through it like a TV show and figured out what exactly happened. I didn't even think of this woman for much of my adult life. But now, everything's a lot clearer. So - just please talk to someone. Write. Writing is incredible, and it doesn't even cost anything. But if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for - that's what matters. ",

    "selftext": "Kind of an inflammatory title but it comes with a story and a bit of advice so buckle in.\n\nGrowing up I didnt have any problems with mental health. I was raised southern Baptist, worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers. When I could walk I learned home improvement, drywall, painting, ect. I was raised to be strong, protect my sisters and my mom. I was raised that men dont cry, men dont hurt. I grew up thinking that I had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard. \n\nFast forward to 2 years ago. I was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when I saw a guy leaning in the window of a car. (Drug deals not uncommon out in the open) He turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street. I slammed my car to a stop, threw up the brake and jumped out, not knowing what was happening. \n\nI always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side. I approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door. When they stood up the only thing I remember seeing was the barrel of their gun. Couldn't tell you what they looked like, what color the car was, hell even if it was a guy or a girl. I pulled my weapon when I saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours, days. I wasnt breathing. We just started at each other while I was aimed dead in that person's chest. \n\nI didnt pull the trigger.\n\nThe person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and I holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street. He was shot in the lower left of his back, blood pumping out of a small circle wound. Holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other I tried to stop and much bleeding as possible. After hanging up with 911 the wait began. \n\nI took my jacked off and laid it under him. (With it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible. Help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later. My hand had frozen, literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood. \n\nGreg was his first name and he made a full recovery.\n\nI moved on from that day different. Over the course of the next year I would have night terrors of the image of that gun, the blood pumping out of his skin, being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive. I couldn't be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave. I didnt trust new people I was meeting. I was scared to be alone at any times. It came to a head when I tried to end everything. \n\nWith out going into it to much I didnt. I went straight to family for help and explained everything. My mom took me in, I found a therapist that I enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors. The first time I talked to the therapist I cried. I cried and cried for the first time in my life. Cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go. I was vulnerable and she held me through it. She understood and didnt judge. She saved me.\n\nOne year of therapy later I have a totally different outlook on mental health. After reading through this sub I figured this story could help someone. It is okay for men to hurt. It doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something. It is okay to break down and not have the solutions. \n\nPlease, if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having \"something wrong\" or being broken in some way, there is help. I am forever grateful I found help when I did.\n\nSorry if the story is kinda rushed or mistyped, kinda a hard subject to bring up.\n\nThis is my first reddit account and I couldn't think of a better way to join the sight than joining a community designed to help each other. I look forward to speaking with many of you!",

There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. \n\nIt really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact. \n\nI hope someone sees this and knows they can advocate to their therapist for something different, because I have had to multiple times and it is not easy.",

I called all the closest people in his life and they came over and stayed so I wasn’t alone. He was okay with it and told me he needed help, to please help him. We started off going to a voluntary inpatient. He was in the waiting room and it was going well, until he broke. He threatened everyone there and stripped down naked. At that point they called some firefighters to take him to a regular hospital to make sure there were no drugs in his system. There weren’t. He was okay in the hospital as well, until he wasn’t. He got super angry and scared, which is understandable. But he threatened everyone there as well. I know that’s not my husband. But he continued to threaten me and told me he’s going to kill me and that he’s the devil. At that point I had to leave the room, I was legitimately scared for my life. Now we’re at the point where he might have to go to a court ordered treatment. I’m so so scared for him and wish I could take him home but there’s no way I can without getting really hurt or dying. I know treatment facilities aren’t great. But please someone tell it’s okay what I had to do. I really hope I see my real husband again, and when I do I hope he forgives me for leaving that hospital room when he threatened to kill me and “make me feel loved”. I’m not okay, he’s not okay. I just need to feel not so alone.",

They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. \n\nWe had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. \n\nShe labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. \n\nAround 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.\n\n They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. \n\nWhen the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. \n\nSo I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. \n\nBoth baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head.

She exuded warmth and light. She saved my life.\n\nI have suffered from OCD, anxiety, and depression for 9 years. It has taken so much from me, but this loss was particularly cruel.\n\nI believe I am speaking through Annika when I ask you to please stay. Please fight for your life. You matter. I love you. It does get better. I have been on medical leave of absence many times, I have seen more than a dozen providers, and I have given up on my biggest dream. I am also first-generation, and I have experienced the stigma surrounding mental illness in my community firsthand. But in this particular moment, I feel peace and love. I could not have imagined that on my darkest day. Your fight is valid and you are strong; please reject anything that suggests otherwise. Please take strength from Annika's words and my journey. Please carry on with the hope that she instilled in me. This life can still be beautiful for you.\n\nAnd now, I ask that you please help me honor this beautiful soul.\n\nAnnika said, 'I admired and adored \\[Avril Lavigne\\] so much when I was a teenager, her music literally saved me back then.' She had a ticket for Avril’s concert in Germany—it would have been her second time—but it was cancelled due to COVID.\n\nIf you have Twitter, please help me reach Avril by retweeting my post with a comment, tagging **Avril Lavigne** and **The Avril Foundation**. My Twitter handle, if the link doesn't work, is simply 'libbyredda'. I've pinned the tweet.\n\n[https://twitter.com/libbyredda/status/1294731897050865664?s=20](https://twitter.com/libbyredda/status/1294731897050865664?s=20)\n\nIf you do not have Twitter, please post an Instagram story with a screenshot of the tweet and tag the same accounts.\n\nAnd if you have any other suggestions or connections, let’s use them too!\n\nPlease help me do one last special thing for Annika. Your support means everything to me.\n\nAnnika deserved every drop of magic in this world. And you do too :) Please let her witness this from wherever she is watching us.\n\nThank you with all my heart. Keep fighting, my warriors! Annika and I believe in you!”",

    "selftext": "First time posting here, please don’t mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don’t do much about suicidal students. \n\nWhen I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. \n\nI remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn’t kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s\n\nAnyway, it upsets me that they didn’t do anything more about this. They didn’t mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn’t have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. \n\nSchools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don’t really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that’s the case.",

    "selftext": "I’m from an Indian (India not Native American) family. They were born in India, but I was born here in the United States. I’ve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I’ve always faced so much racism. I’ve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. \n\nThe media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I’m just expected to suck it up. \n\nI tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can’t. I’ve been told to “go home” by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I’ll never be seen as a true American. \n\nDespite that I just can’t stand it any more. It’s not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That’s the real depressive thing. \n\nAnyway, this isn’t to say that all Americans are like this. I’ve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. \n\nI was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I’m so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I’m ethnically Indian won’t be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I’ll be “the American” and not “the Indian.” \n\nSystemic Barriers like racial preferences in college admissions don’t exist at top universities like they do here. I went to college at UVA, and while it was leagues better than high school in terms of overt racism, the invalidation and indifference of overt racism toward ethnic Indians was still 100% there. So if I have kids, they’ll grow up in a country where their skin color isn’t their defining factor. \n\nI don’t mean to offend anyone with this soapbox. If you’re an American who gets what I’m saying, then thank you, and I am grateful that people like you exist. I acknowledge you and will never lump you in with the other people alluded to.",

    "selftext": "November 2020 my best friend(17F) committed suicide. It was honestly one of the most traumatic things I've ever had to go through, and my boyfriend(18M) and I also broke up about a week after her death. (Just to clarify, he didn't break up with me because he didn't want to deal with me going through my best friend's suicide. Our breakup was a long time coming, it just unfortunately happened at a really bad time).\n\nNovember through January was the most difficult time of my life. I struggled so so much. I think I had so much trauma from that time, that I literally cannot remember a single thing from those two and a half months. I just remember this constant feeling of numbness and having a breakdown every couple of days. I missed my ex-boyfriend and I missed my best friend so so much. Somehow I've lost my two best friends, the two most important people in my life only eight days apart. It was awful. \n\nI'm doing much much better now. I've made new friends, I've kissed new boys, I'm going to social events with my friends (Covid is currently under control in my country, don't worry xx). I've realized that breaking up with my now ex-boyfriend was one of the best things I've EVER done for myself. Please don't get me wrong, he's a phenomenal person with a beautiful heart. I still have so much love for him, but we weren't meant to be together in the long run, and I've realized that now. Our relationship became toxic, not because either of us were toxic individuals, but because we weren't good for each other anymore. \n\nAs for my best friend... Zara my beautiful beautiful angel. I miss you every day, but I know how much pain you were in. This world didn't deserve you, sunflower-child. I still feel you everywhere around me. I feel you when the sun hits my back when I'm laughing with my friends at school, I feel you when I'm making out with younger boys on golf courses and I know you would've approved. I feel you around me when I'm drinking beers with my boys and dancing with my girls.  You're always around, I know it!\n\nI miss you so much, but I know you're in a place where you're happy, and that you're finally at a place where you don't have pain and where you can truly be yourself. I love you, you selfless and kind person.\n\n\nTo the people who read this post, I truly hope that you are doing well. I wish you the best. I just really needed to write my feelings out and hit post. To send it into the universe. Please remember that things do get better ♡\n\nAll my love\nTijloscoop x",

Words I now carry with me every moment of every day. \n\nI was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. \n\nLooking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It’s such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn’t stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. \n\nIt’s been sixteen months and no one has “moved on”.  It’s something we carry with us every day. It’s part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. \n\nMy niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn’t see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn’t hold on any longer. \n\nI’m grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. \n\nLife will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don’t want everything to be ok because it’s not.  We’re not and never will be. We’re all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn’t help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. \n\nWhat I wouldn’t give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. \n\nIf you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.  You can even confidentially call or text counselors who can help. I posted the link below. \n\nhttps://suicidepreventionlifeline.org\n\nYou are loved and you deserve happiness. You deserve a future.

    "selftext": "So I (27M) moved house yesterday away from my ex girlfriend who was emotionally abusive and controlling since we first started dating 9 years ago and only recently did I realise how bad she actually was. \n\nWe broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous I just want to cry. Even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect, she'd burst into my room at random moments without knocking, no matter what I was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and I was called rude if my replies weren't what she wanted. She'd never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house, it was all just her decisions and that was final. \n\nI've just moved into a share house which I was terrified about since I've never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell. it's a weird feeling not having anyone to \"answer\" to any more but I guess it's the feeling of actual freedom! \n\nAfter narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too Its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today. And to anyone else that's around these type of people you need to listen to what your heart is telling you, your more important than anyone else, look after and love yourself first!! \nI really needed to vent this out and thank you for reading. Much love to all",

    "selftext": "I always feel like anything I say or think is “being dramatic” like in dealing with Jeckyl and Hyde in my head.  I worry and stress about things that have happened, will happen, might happen, might not happen, or surely won’t happen.  My day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where I get a migraine, cry it out, hold it in, get mad.... I’ve been on anxiety medication... all of them, off and on for years.  At the point now where I’m too anxious to take anxiety medication because I’m anxious to get side effects.  Backwards I know...  I’ve seen a therapist before but not for awhile.  I always felt like I was bothering them.\n\nBut I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I’m married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there’s no issues... but most days I end my day thinking “I feel like if I just were to die, I wouldn’t have to deal with these feelings anymore, and I’d be free.” And that’s in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that I alone put in my head.  But I don’t want to die.  I’m afraid of dying actually.  \n\nI’ve been fine my entire life except for when I had my second son 11 years ago.  He was born with club foot.  I spent all my maternity leave going to Children’s hospital for castings, surgery, etc. He had an MRI last year and got orthopedics.  He’s fine and happy and healthy.  But since he was born I changed and I’ve developed panic attacks, anxiety, depression, IBS that put me in the ER 4 times, ulcers.  I worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop.  I can’t stop the play button.  \n\nSo yes this is kind of venting but I’m at a loss and I try not to talk about this with anything because I feel like I’m being too whiny and dramatic.  Everyone’s response is always your son is fine now, basically get over it.  But I’ve always felt like I had some sort of PTSD (I don’t know if that’s actually what it would be) after my sons situation because I’ve never gotten over what he went through and what I went through mentally and financially because of it.\n\nAny advice on where I should go from here or what I should do... would be appreciated.",

They literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam.

They kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness. \n\nAgain I'm just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off, they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it.

I had to explain to them that you can still struggle with your mental health even if you're not diagnosed with any mental illness and they told me that I can't say that I'm feeling depressed without actually being diagnosed with depression.

I knew I had severe anxiety and I hated myself more than words can explain. But I thought it was completely my fault - that I was a broken person. I thought I would never heal. I thought nobody would ever understand me. I just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who I am as an adult. I never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who I am today. It wasn't simply just a \"chemical imbalance; end of story\". You may not have experienced anything even remotely similar to what I have, but I hope after reading this some of you will start thinking and start seeing connections to your inner abused child that is still suffering from what happened to you in the past.\n(Please google CPTSD if you haven't already heard of it.)\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nI'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*\n\nThe worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. \"We accept the love we think we deserve.\" \nThankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.\n\nI was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking \"why do I have to be me?\" and \"what's wrong with me?\". My self esteem was non-existent. \n\nI remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?\n\nMy self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? \n\nOf course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. \"They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me.\" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. \"Lots of nervous laughter.\" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. \"Why can't I be like the regular kids?\" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.\n\nI was embarrassed of my own existence.\n\nWhen I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. \n\nBy 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. \n\nAfter I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.\nEnded up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.\n\nI was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. \n\nBy high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.\n\nFast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.\n\nTwo weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.\n\nAt the hospital I was told \"you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment\". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.\n\nInside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, \"what is wrong with me?\"\n\nMemories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.\n\nNow, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. \nI now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have \"social anxiety.\" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. \n\nLearning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. \n\nI encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.\n\nPlease remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.\n\nThe cycle of abuse ends with us!",

Unfortunately, I also took something and had to face the consequences of it. When I took it (I won't say which drug) I felt bad, I felt like I was dying, I noticed that something was about to happen (collapse) and that's why I tried with all my might to tell my girlfriend to come with me. Simply that she is there. When we were at the toilet, the last thing that occurred to me was how she locked the door and I fell asleep on the floor. idk what happened. I woke up with her on top of me. In her couch at her home. I didn't have the strength to talk, she just did it. She gave me a bj at the end and then got off me. I wasn't fully conscious but I indicated to her that I didn't really want it. I wanted to cry but no, I packed my things and went home. Im fcked up. I fcked it up.

    "title": "My experience in a psych ward",
    "selftext": "Last Saturday, February 27th, was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me, I had really bad thoughts about harming her, like if I could end her life all my problems would be fixed. See, she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that I thought was bipolar disorder. \n\nI had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist, and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder. So, I started taking medicine for it. Now, let's jump back to last Saturday.\n\nI realized these thoughts I were having were dangerous and that I needed serious help immediately, so I told my parents to take me to the hospital, being a bit vague on the details, and they did. I got to the ER and told the nurse everything that had been happening and I was sent to a bare room with only a boxed-in tv on the wall as an SIHI, meaning I was both suicidal and homocidal. \n\nThe doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me. After 4 hours of waiting, I got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient. So, within 15min, I was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away, and I had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies. Once I had completed the paperwork, I was made to put on a pair of no-slip socks for safety and was shown to my room. \n\nIt was a fairly bare room, with just a desk to store what few clothes I could bring and two beds. I had to share my room with a nice old man named Arthur, who was there for mild schizophrenia. We also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. \n\nThe operation of the psych ward were fairly simple. Meals were at 7:30, 11, and 4:30, and snacks were at 9, 2, and 8:30. We had \"group,\" at 10, 3, and 8 where we learned coping mechanism, positive thinking skills, and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity.\n\n They didnt force you to eat or go to group, though. Some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day. Most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv. We ended up watching HGTV or the Food Network most of the time. We did watch some Star Wars, too,  which was nice\n\nEach shift change, a new nurse was assigned to you, and they were all very nice in my experience. They brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm. Every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was, to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1-10, and so forth. \n\nYour doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital, as well as discuss or change your medications. My doctor ended up changing my Lexapro for Prozac, upping my dosage of Lamictal, and adding Remoron to the mix. \n\nAlongside the doctor, I also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation. He let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how I got to the psych ward, and he filled up 3 pages full of notes. Afterwards, I took a 567 true/false quiz called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Rorschach Test. \n\nI was in the psych ward until today, March 3rd. Before I left, I had one last talk with my doctor, who gave me a briefing on the psychologist's report. It turns out, I have autism. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that was a pretty big shock to me. \n\nI think the biggest thing I learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me. They're completely normal people who just need some help. None of them were mean or psychopaths. They were all just average joes with bad anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them. \n\nSo, thanks for reading about my experience in a psych ward. I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have",

Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.\n\nBut if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). \n\nAdditionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.\n\nHope this helps someone out ❤️\n\n\nEdit: \nAs this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. \n\nThis post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that. It helped me and I hope that someone out there who's in a similar situation as I am/was can benefit from the experience I had.",

    "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom. \n\n\nGrowing up, my mood was unpredictable. It was a constant state of anger, immaturity, anxiety, and fear. My parents gave me stuff I wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues. They thought I would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers. Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn’t want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I’m scared and “(friend) doesn’t want to go with me.  I don’t want to go to the car” (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn’t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn’t think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. \n\nGrowing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father’s moods and sometimes my mother’s. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn’t hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an “eh” manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like “meh” and didn’t. I didn’t realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn’t give a coherent “yes” to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn’t think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don’t think they was the correct parental way to go about things. \n\nThere were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn’t get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn’t want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told “she doesn’t want to play with you. That’s not my problem”, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... \n\nI was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go “oh wow I really wasn’t a normal kid”.\n\ntldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.",

So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't \"sweat more\" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. \n\nBut if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.\nI'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone.

    "selftext": "Just needed to vent this out: REALLY sick of the trivialization of mental illnesses, but lately especially the notion that mania is *cute* or that being a manic girl is somehow attractive. I currently intern in inpatient psych, and the bipolar patients I work with often cause major destruction to their lives during manic periods. It’s just gross. The memefication of mental illness is disturbing.\n\nEdit: in case I was unclear—I’m referring to people who are NOT bipolar, who romanticize mania when they do not have to deal with the things people who have the disorder do have to deal with.\n\nEdit 2: I realize the “manic pixie dream girl” trope was not an appropriate reference. Learned my lesson y’all.",

    "selftext": "Ok, I understand that guilt is a huge factor when it comes to people who struggle with mental health. I have been diagnosed with DID and Severe Generalized Anxiety. It has taken me years of medications, various therapists and learned coping mechanisms to be the overall functioning human I am today.  Everyday is still a struggle but, I’m at peace with that and just take things as they come. \n\nThe problem I have is that I sometimes feel like I don’t deserve to have a mental illness. If that makes sense. I had a rough childhood, but when I start to have a break down or anxiety attack, I always think something along the lines of \n\n“There are definitely people that have had it worse than I have and they are just fine.” \nOr\n“Whatever is happening isn’t as bad as what other people go through and I should just suck it up” \n\nMy rational healthy brain tells me everything is relative blah, blah, blah. All the logical things a normal brain would think. Then my unhealthy brain just yells over the logic with intrusive thoughts that I don’t deserve to have these mental issues because my life “isn’t that bad”\n\nI feel like I may not be doing the best job of describing what I’m feeling lol but can anyone relate?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments and support. It always makes things a little easier to know Im not alone in this way of thinking. I hope this posts helps others to realize the same thing. You are valid, you matter and the world would not be better without you in it. Stay safe and peaceful, my friends.",

I assume it was super amusing making fun of me based on the giggles and laughs from your group behind me as I used the self check out for the few things I was buying. Since you lot are obviously comedic geniuses I thought I'd share your wittisms.\n\n\"Omg why would she ever leave her house in shorts?!\" Said by the pretty blonde girl whose shirt I internally admired earlier. \n\nYou were pretty spot on since I'd hadn't worn shorts outside my home in almost 2 years. I had finally found a pair that fit well and were long enough so I thought they looked ok. Thank you for disabusing me of that notion.\n\n\"She probably doesn't leave the house often anyway. Maybe she's afraid she won't fit through the door one of these days.\" Said from who I assume was blondie's boyfriend. \n\nWell, you were wrong about the door thing, that's a full on exaggeration because even I know I'm not that big. However you were right about me not leaving the house often but it has nothing to do with weight. It's because I'm still severely depressed over the unexpected passing of my fiancé less than 2 years ago.\n\n\"Look she's buying spinach! I guarantee it's not for her!\" This was from the brunette with blue highlights. \n\nSorry to disappoint but it's totally for me.\n\n\"Why doesn't she just get that weight loss surgery? She would obviously qualify.\" From a different brunette. \n\nWell actually honey, I already had it when I was 17 and barely qualified. This was in the very early days of bariatric surgery and I obviously didn't have ideal results. What's even worse though is it's left me with multiple, life long health issues and chronic pain. I've had to have several additional surgeries to try and correct things, with little success. A lot of those health issues mean medication and many of those medications have weight gain as a side effect. I also have Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which both can cause weight gain. As can depression, which I mentioned earlier.\n\n\"I'd kill myself if I ever got that big.\" Said by blondie. \n\nI guess it's A: good you're not because no matter how horrible your comments I would never wish for you to feel like you needed to die and B: I guess I'm mentally stronger than you. That's probably because of all the shit I've been through but believe me there are often days when I think I'd be better off dead. And I'd be lying if I didn't say how hard it was after hearing your comments to just make it to my car before I broke down crying. \n\nI don't know why you all felt the need to be so cruel but I hope eventually you learn to have a little more empathy. You don't know me or my story, but you judged me based solely on my weight and found me lacking. Therefore I was worthy of your scorn. \n\nYour comments hurt, and I imagine they will stick with me for awhile, but they won't break me. However, someday, if you continue this act you might end up being the last straw that does break someone. I hope you never have to realize that your comments pushed a person to end their life and I also hope you never have to feel the way you made me feel today. \n\nEveryone, please just keep in mind that you don't know what people are going through. Do better, because not only is there no award for being a bad human but karma enjoys being an ironic bitch.",

We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don’t go,** then don’t go. And don’t tell me that it’s easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.\n\nYou  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it’s true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.\n\nI challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it’s better than turkey  anyway.\n\nUntil next time my friend…\n\nBe Unbroken,\n\n\\-@MichaelUnbroken",

    "selftext": "I know I sound like a wimp, but keep reading.\n\nI am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. \n\nOne of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. \n\nThis girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. \n\nWhen we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.\n\nI forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. \n\nI will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Client almost got me and a car full of people killed, and I can't get over the fear of being around her now. How do I get over this fear and continue my job as a mental health tech?",

If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. \n\nThe importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.\n\nBut where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-your-compassion-doesnt-include-yourself-its-incomplete/id1493806566?i=1000501429571)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/If-your-compassion-doesnt-include-yourself--its-incomplete-end5ej)",

    "title": "Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?",
    "selftext": "I'm 29. At age 13 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and about six months ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge. The first time I had mental health problems I was four or five years old. I got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when I was five (don't want to get too much into why I was put in but basically I had extreme trouble regulating my emotions), and it was at that point that I internalized the thought (or message I thought I was getting) that I was bad and wrong and messed up. A year later my mom died from cancer and I thought I had made her sick because I stressed her out too much from being \"bad\". So again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed. Then I went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because I was fat (from comfort eating because of losing my mom) and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash. Around age 10 was the first time I wanted to die. Age 13 I was hospitalized again for being suicidal. I've been on about 10-12 various medications (at different times) since I was 13 trying to treat my mental health. I have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments. And despite all that nothing helped me 100% or even 50%. I still was depressed and anxious, I developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years, I still hated myself and had very low self-esteem and self-injured and felt suicidal and just...dark.\n\nAt 29 I still feel like I'm just destined to be this way. My biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder recently before he died. My mother's side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction. I just feel like I'm destined to be and stay mentally ill. And I feel like it's part of my identity. Ever since my mom died I've gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me. I feel I'm just a broken person and I've felt it so long I really internalized it at a very early age. I know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark, self-hating, self-sabotaging thoughts are all I have known for practically all my life, they are.... comforting to me in a strange way. It feels.... right? to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world. I can't see myself being any other way. I feel like it's formed my personality? I'm not really sure. I just... at this point in my life I can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior, or long-term hospitalized. Obviously neither of those I would like, but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening. Like, \"...meh, you're a piece of shit and so messed up anyways, you're just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn't be a big deal and would be better in the long run.\"\n\nI'll end here before I continue rambling on. Basically, I feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my DNA and is in every part of me and I can't find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that I deserve that change or that it will even ever happen. Additionally I feel like I have no idea who I would be without it. Has anyone felt this? Can anyone relate?",

I was put on new medication, started therapy, moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life.\n\nNow, I’m traveling Europe alone for the first time. I’m doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I’d see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. \n\nI’m so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I’m glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I’m glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.\n\nI still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.\n\nCheers xx\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your support! I wanted to clarify that I wasn’t meaning to brag or seem like I just dropped everything and hopped on a plane. I actually planned this trip back in January, before my attempt, which perhaps makes it even more profound. I was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery, but after six months I’m finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me. Getting on the plane felt terrifying, but I’m so glad I went through with something that is good for me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It’s a chance to sit with my thoughts and take in the world around me. My Eurotrip can be your anything—going somewhere new or sitting in a park you pass everyday. I just want you to feel as alive as I do!\n\nMuch love",

    "selftext": "\nI think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‘feeling depressed’ or a bit ‘anxious’ is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. \nIt needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don’t have to be ashamed. \nPretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too “other people have it so much worse than me” or “im just over exaggerating.” This is not how things should be. People shouldn’t have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?\nIf everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who’s lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ❤️\n\n\nPS. Mental health in general needs to be spoken about a lot more. I just talked about anxiety and depression in this because i feel they are considered less serious than other mental illnesses by many. Thank you for reading!",

I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. \n\nWhy is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything\n\nI feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.\n\nI know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact",

Which is fine, I get it, things happen and people make other plans. However, one weekend I decided not to ask because I’d already asked the last few weeks prior and then I checked Snapchat to find that a few friends I asked posted pictures of a hike that they did together on their story. I’m sure you can imagine how shitty this felt having asked to do a hike several times, being bailed on or told no, and then finding out my “friends” decided to do a hike without me.

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: this isn’t targeted at any one individual or group, but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health. If I say “you” or “you people”, I’m referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I’m about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y’all could appreciate my sentiment instead.\n\nIt seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.\n\n*”DuH… like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!”*\n\nJust, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here’s why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.\n\nFirst off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they’re depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of “oh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they’re not *really* depressed.”\n\nThis is such bullshit because unless you’ve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else’s thoughts, you don’t know what the fuck they’re going through. Even if that “normal” person seems functional, there’s no telling what’s going on in their head. \n\nYou think everyone who has “real” depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there’s probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have “real” depression. They just hide it well because that’s what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.\n\nSecond, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. “This person has depression and ADHD, but doesn’t take care of themselves and can’t hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That’s not mental illness, that’s *laziness*”.\n\nLike, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That’s literally what severe mental illness does to you? If “depression” can’t exist if you’re doing well on the surface, and it *also* can’t exist if you’re doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?\n\nBut even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it’s *still* fucked up to call someone out as a “faker”.\n\nLook at it this way, let’s say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don’t.\n\n*WHO FUCKING CARES?*\n\nEven if they don’t have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren’t getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there’s absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don’t* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!\n\nAnd here’s the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?\n\nMental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it’s a **M E N T A L** illness. \n\nSo why take the chance on saying “oh they’re just lying for attention”, when there’s a strong possibility that they’re serious and you’re just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?\n\nSeriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for “faking it”? \n\n“Oh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.”\n\nBull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn’t coming from people who actually care about mental health.\n\nIt’s coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It’s just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren’t getting them because they’re constantly told that they’re making it worse for people who have “real” mental illness.\n\nAnd one more thing.\n\n“Oh you probably self-diagnosed, didn’t you? That means your mental illness isn’t real.”\n\nOh, fuuuuuuck off.\n\nFirst of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say “yep, you’ve got depression”. That’s not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.\n\nAnd what about people who *can’t* get diagnosed? I’m lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.\n\nWhat about people who aren’t so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It’s chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That’s a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.\n\nSo if you’re in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you “might be faking it”? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.\n\nBottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn’t dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?\n\nYou’re not helping anyone. You’re not saving resources for people who “actually” need them. All you’re doing is making everybody feel worse.",

    "selftext": "Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.\n\nSociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.\n\nBoth of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.\n\nReddit uses these terms the way people used \"retarded\" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.\n\nIt's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)\n\nWhenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.\n\n\nAnd how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!\n\nTl;dr \"narcissist\" and \"sociopath\" are the new retard, and it's disgusting.",

Either way, they didn't specify nor did they tell me if the actual results are likely higher or lower)\n\n\nThis is very demotivating, It makes me abstain from studying thinking that I will immediately get distracted or forget everything once I finish reading.

I noticed that my feelings get worse when I'm scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and \"lives\" of other people and friends. I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.\n\nWho else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health? I think I won't delete Instagram as it's something a bit important like WhatsApp. Well ok it's not even near as important as WhatsApp but I don't know I probably would miss some things as I already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that I sent you. But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp & Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.\n\nI would love to read about your experiences and suggestions! Much love to everyone with depression, it's only the brain telling us false things and emotions. It's not reality.

    "title": "33 m. I had sex with my therapist after two years of being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder.",
    "selftext": "So this is a long one. Going to try and keep it short, and be available to answer questions.\n\nTwo years ago, with nearly 20 years of mood swings, sadness, anger, substance abuse, and hyper sexual behaviors behind me, I decided it was time to get help. My wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce, and my life had become unmanageable.\n\nI started seeing a psychologist through the VA. I’m an army veteran. She turned out to be a specialist in BPD and after some time was able to diagnose me. I had always suspected either BPD or Bipolar. \n\nWe’ve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress. She leads a Dialectic Behavioral Therapy group that worked wonders for me. It was life changing. Emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance are all part of my life now. I’m not perfect, and I’m always willing to put in the work, but life is better than ever before. I truly feel like my BPD is in recession. I also recently got sober, which helps a lot.\n\nSo this last February my wife and I separated. This is primarily due to my unstable moods, anger issues, substance abuse, and hyper sexuality. I moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine.\n\nMy last appointment with my therapist, I mentioned that I understood I was in a vulnerable situation and I was taking dating very cautiously. Being roughly 70 days sober, not completely over my ex, and prone to emotional dependency, I need to really consider my actions and emotions. I’m in a vulnerable place where I could relapse in a few different ways.\n\nWell two days after that she texts me at 11:30 pm and starts flirting with me. She’s never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so.\n\nShe even mentioned the fact that I said I was vulnerable, and stated she felt vulnerable as well.\n\nI at first told her I wasn’t available because I had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while I figured out where it was going. Also, I’m not attracted to this woman.\n\nAnother day goes by and I can’t fight the curiosity. I started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant. Asking her about why she likes me. What she’s into. What she would do to me. What she wants me to do to her.\n\nHere’s the thing. I have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who I’m not attracted to because I like the attention, I like being used, and I like things that feel taboo. I almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens. And this woman, more than anyone knows all of that about me. \n\nWell two nights after she texted me for the first time, I went over to her place to give her what she wanted. She didn’t pressure me to, so we were both consenting, but it doesn’t feel good now. I almost immediately realized I wasn’t into what I was doing, but I stayed and kept doing things until I got her off. Then I left.\n\nLooking back on it, it feels a little predatory. Here’s the person I’ve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they’ve always made me feel bad. And I end up getting baited into just that. \n\nI’m not going to report her. At this point I should have better control over myself. But I’m disappointed in both of us.\n\nI’ve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist. She did so happily and respectfully, and the new one feels like a great fit. \n\nThere ya go.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post. I have to admit, I was honestly struggling with whether or not I should feel bad about this situation. It’s pretty clear now that what she did was wrong. Had the cards not been so stacked in her favor, she’s definitely not someone I would’ve been intimate with.\n\nSo here’s the update, and I’ll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied. I reached out to her and told her exactly how I feel about what happened, how it was manipulative and I’m left feeling used. She seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why I felt that way. I say “seemed” because to be brutally honest I don’t know if this is a one time fuck up, or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing. Of course when you get called out on doing something wrong, you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation. So who the fuck knows. \n\nI want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse, trauma, and the like. I think it’s important to make yourself available to listen, offer support, and support them in finding closure, however they deem necessary. I’ve had friends who were assaulted and didn’t report it, and I tried to understand that it’s their closure to find, not mine.\n\nShe said I’d be well within my rights to report this, if I decided to do so. I’m not planning on reporting her. I’m not blaming myself for what happened, but again it’s not uncommon for me to get myself into situations I regret like this. I’ve expressed how I feel about it, I’m choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful (choosing because again, I’ll never really know) and I’m moving on. It’s not fair to be taken advantage of, but I also don’t feel like it’s fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process. \n\nGo easy on me, but this is where I’m at with it. Who knows, I may end up feeling differently about it in the future. Hell even as I write this I’m thinking “did she ever care about my well being? She never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me. Even after I’d cry in a meeting and tell her I don’t know what to do, and I couldn’t fix my life, I couldn’t control myself. She never texted. It was only when she wanted sex that she went there”. Yeah. Idk. That’s where I’m at. Sorry to let y’all down. \n\nThanks again for the validation and support.",

    "selftext": "Living with a mother who has a mental illness, caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child. It has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression. \n\nMy mom had her own business and was very successful. When I was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business. I didn’t know it at the time, but she started doing heavy drugs. She would constantly pass out and not eat for days. \n\nAt 8, I was no longer a child but a parent. I remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter. As a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so I could get my license. When in reality, she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy. Few years later, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. She had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house. She was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was later court ordered to stay in a half way house. After her time was up, she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her. \n\nAnosognosia has serious consequences. I’ve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn’t admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention. They convinced themselves that she would somehow “snap out of it.” \n\nHere’s my main point in all of this, if a person does not think that they need help they will NOT get treatment. In coping with my own mental issues, forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health. Instead of fighting it, accept it for what it is  Stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic. Sometimes we don’t need help in the way you think is best. We don’t need further rejection or guilt. Most times we just need support. We need love.",

It was just weird.\n\nShe had a weird obsession with my underwear. She would smell my used clothes in front of me a lot. Sometimes she would call me over and smell my underwear while I was wearing it. If I told her no, she would tell me that it was her job as a mother to do this and that all moms do this with their children. She said it was her favorite smell. This kept going into my teenage years.\n\nWe had this weird joke about me not wearing underwear. So sometimes she’d check. She’d touch my butt or my genital area to see if she could feel it beneath my pants. Other times she’d also just pull back my pants and just look. The last time I remember her doing this was when I was 20.\n\nShe used to walk around the house completely naked, but stopped after my dad got angry and told her it was inappropriate to do that in front of us.\n\nWhen I was around 16-17, she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her while she was naked. She would hold me against her body, and her genitals would touch my skin. When I told her I didnt like doing that, she would get upset and told me that it was natural. I got scared when she did this to me, and after I told her that I was scared she would rape me she stopped. I feel a lot of guilt for saying this.\n\nAround the same time, I came out to her as a transgender man (and still am a man today) and she didn’t react well. Sometimes she would lightly touch my chest and try to get me to appreciate my female body.\n\nThis is all I can remember at the moment. I feel sick and scared when I interact with her sometimes, and I don’t know if it’s really justified. \n\n",

Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you’re struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.\n\nBut believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.\n\nAnd let me tell you, when happiness IS finally an option for you again, you will choose it and feel it so deeply in your soul.

I don't even have a pet.\nBut, I realized, I do have something to live for, which is myself. I want to live a life that is kind, bright, and warm. I want to have a future, I don't care if it's even alone, I just want to be happy and loved, even if it's only by myself.

    "title": "After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love",
    "selftext": " I have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Things have been very hard in the past, but right now, I feel really happy on my relationship and I do envision a long term future with this person. I don't exactly know why I am writing this, but since I feel like sharing a little of my story with the world, I thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where I am now.\n\nThings were really hard in the beginning. My partner was very unstable and deeply depressed, simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot. Huge anxiety was easily triggered, that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts, specially at night. Sometimes it lasted a couple of days, sometimes it lasted weeks, or a month. I really felt like on the more \"happy\" and stable days I had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like \"coming back\" from the pit hole was worth it. I felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me. I knew I couldn't really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but I just kept insisting and insisting because I thought that if I stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone.\n\nIt was rough. Sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that I thought I was in love with a man that would never love me. I felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because I was supporting everything I could but I couldn't really have that back because my partner was living in a \"survival\" mode. When he became more willing to share, our communication also improved, he shared more with me and I learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes. Also, therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course. There's no partner that can cure an illness, it can make it less difficult, for sure, but only the right treatment can really make it better. Fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility, he has plans for the future with me, he's stable, for the most part, he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check, and he's happy. I wouldn't be with anyone else but him. I'm more confident than I have ever been, for the first time I feel someone truly sees me. and values me. We're both on our early 20s and starting our careers, I hope we can move in together in the near future, of course there are still bad times, but I do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times.\n\nI love him deeply, I'm so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he's no longer suicidal. I am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he's becoming and let himself love and be loved too. There's no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep, I now it sounds very cheesy, but it's really the truth for me, it does feel like heaven.\n\nIf you're on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner's mental health, I don't mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because I know how brutal and lonely it can be. Mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it, but also to others close to them. On a relationship, it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together, so, by no means I believe that the answer is always to stay. I only want to say that sometimes, it takes time and work, but things do get better, a lot better.",

I got sick of feeling awful every day, I got sick of not being happy, sick of not wanting to wake up every day and sick of feeling lower than bedrock.

I guess she should be given extraordinary awards for that. Mother of the year, am I right? It’s like the equivalent to a parent saying “I could’ve neglected you but I didn’t.

I really thought I was going to go through with it. Things got all blurry, but my heart started racing. I honestly felt more at peace in that moment than I have in years. Then my cat started scratching at the door behind me. The closer I felt myself to passing out, the more she started scratching. Listening to her frantic scratching is not what I wanted to hear in my last moments. And it kept reminding me that there was something that cared about me. It made me feel so guilty and horrible. Just added to the bullshit. But I love my cat and my husband and my friends but I am so tired. My job has sucked the life out of me for the last 4 years and I can't take the stress anymore. I feel like they'd be happier not having to worry about me anymore. Its almost like I'm mad at these people (and cat) for caring so much about me. It makes this process take so much more thought and deliberation. All of which I thought I had done beforehand this time. I want to cry for help but I can't because it makes me feel like even more of a burden. I'm only 26 why the hell am I like this. Im so mad. Sure my life hasn't been the greatest but it sure as hell hasn't been as bad as it could have been. I hate feeling all of these things. I'm in therapy and taking an antidepressant but I don't feel like anything is working anymore. I feel like my mind just won't stop. Ever. My coping skills don't always work and I'm tired.

Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes (haven't fully unpacked yet), then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid.\n\nAnyway, the guy that immediately pulled me over was... just a really, really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was incredibly thick, in my defense). Sounded like an absolute nervous wreck. And he listened. And he was really empathetic, just letting me off with a warning.\n\nThe funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking \"man, this guy must think I'm some huge kind of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because *I* can't properly process my feelings.\"\n\nBut I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. Actually *listen* to what I was going through. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself.\n\nGuys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself \\~\\~even\\~\\~ *especially* when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and 90% of the time, when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.  I think, for the first time in a long time, I can cut the cynicism for one little moment and tell myself *it's gonna be okay...* and actually mean it.",

    "title": "\"Your child, your rules\" is single-handedly the most stupid saying I have ever heard",
    "selftext": "Now, I am speaking from experience when I say that this statement does wayyyyyy more harm than it ever did good. My mother is an abusive POS, father was even worse before he was divorced. Routinely, I would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there. I recently saw a post about parenting, and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that \"your child, your rules\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProblem is, no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied. Sure, it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat-eater. But have you thought this saying through? You're saying that it is this person's child, and that they should be able to make the rules. You are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever. Now, what would you do if you found out this person over/underfeeds their child? What if they feed the child too much junk, or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food? What would you do if, whenever the child speaks up, they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning \"I'm your parent!\"? Now do you see where I'm coming from? Look, that was pretty much my story, so I hope you really listen to what I'm saying. I'm 15 years old and I could tell you that shit is damaging. I don't need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement.   \n\n\n  \nAnd yes, I know this sounds like a giant hyperbole, but it really isn't. Think about it, if you're living with the mentality that \"this is my child, I set the rules for them and no one else\" you are most likely going to turn out as an abusive/narcissistic parent. It's a terrible lesson to be spreading on these subreddits, and are most of the time not even warranted. Being a parent means nothing more than you contributed to the birth and growth of this child, and you are not at all entitled to jack shit if you betray that initial trust. Respect is a two way street, regardless of who you are.",

    "selftext": "I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember – getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest – and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.\n\nSoon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind – I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.\n\nI still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night – the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.\n\nSince then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do – I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.\n\nI got help, of course – talking to some professionals and taking pills – but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.\n\nRecently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:\n\n> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.\n\n> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ”stupid” and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.\n> She became what he expected her to be.\n> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.\n> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.\n> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down — not even if they say, “just kidding” or “can't you take a joke?” Months and years of this “humor” can destroy anyone.\n\nAbuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.\n\nI have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.\n\nSo how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them – think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*\n\nI feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.",

    "selftext": "\n\n\nMy friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn’t care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn’t. That’s not the issue though. \n\nI had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He’d kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. \n\nThe conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. \n\nThere is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can’t talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. \n\nIn the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13\nSource: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers\n\nIn the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. \n\nOnly 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical. \n\nSource: https://www.menshealthforum.org.uk/key-data-mental-health\n\nEven among my friends this sort of “man up talk” happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it’s just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It’s not a “sad cry” I’m just angry. \n\n I had an argument with a close female friend and she said “I’m only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up”. That says my feelings aren’t allowed because I’m male, because apparently I’m not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. \n\nThat other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. \n\nWe need to change the mental health conversation so that it’s not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I’m aware that it isn’t only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.",

And you see that men with big penis are treated with admiration and praise.\n\nIt's been 7 years since mine was referred to as a \"*pencil dick*\" by a woman (not to my face, but to a friend who thought I should know).

My parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating (in my room), wetting the bed, having outbursts, etc. There was legal action taken, I was in counseling for the bare minimum time. \n\n I had horrible nightmares, night terrors, I sleptwalked. My parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom (who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day) up because I had nightmares that made me feel terrified, paralyzed, and unable to go back to sleep. \n\n On one specific occasion, I remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade (only 1-2 years after the abuse had ended) and waking my mom up because I had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me. My parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where I couldn't sleep, when I did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me I didn't deserve to be asleep, I was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up, and that he hoped I didn't sleep all night (I had school the next morning). On top of all of that, they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to (my mom stayed home with me). When they got back my sister had brought me candy, he said I wasn't allowed to have it. He also made a point of saying how everyone asked where I was and he told EVERYONE why I couldn't be there, and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home. \n\n  I confronted my mom about it today (I'm 24) and she just immediately started saying the typical, \"Oh yeah we get it, we're terrible parents, your childhood was terrible.\" She then kept saying I never told them I was having nightmares even though I remember ALWAYS telling them about my nightmares and the only time I didn't get punished was the night I had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid. I told her all I wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone.\n\n  I got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told I would have PTSD after being abused my entire childhood, she said no. So I asked if they seriously didn't have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no. \n\n  My parents were so focused on making me \"normal\" that they traumatized me worse than that abuse ever did and they won't even acknowledge that they did anything wrong.",

    "selftext": " \n\nA Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,\n\nIf you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn’t understand what it’s like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don’t experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...\n\n**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**\n\n**I am so happy** you don’t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.\n\n**I am so happy** you haven’t had to answer any of the further questions that follow “do you feel anxious or depressed?” when visiting the doctor’s office.\n\n**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.\n\nIf you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*\n\nIf you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**\n\n**Don’t ever take it for granted.**\n\nDon’t let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren’t always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.\n\nWhile mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **“quirky”** or **“poetic”** like society makes it seem on social media.\n\nBeing mentally ill isn’t *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. \n\n**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** \n\nSo when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don’t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**\n\n**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**\n\nIsn’t it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?\n\nAnd when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don’t take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should’ve been doing all along. \n\nWhen we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don’t think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren’t dragging you down with us.\n\nPlease do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. \n\nMost of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don’t wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.\n\n**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren’t always sure we can beat.**\n\nHowever, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** \n\nIn fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. \n\nBecause to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe mentally ill",

    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nAt first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a “Crush” sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I’m telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. \n\nLet’s call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I’m going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. \n\nWe come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can’t even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well… temper tantrum time. \n\nShe once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. \n\nAnytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. \n\nOne time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn’t showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. \n\n3 or 4 times a week, Cindy’s mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. \n\nShe then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn’t give her anymore shirts because I don’t have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. \n\nI used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a “crush” or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn’t know what to do. And besides, I’m really not into confrontation, so I didn’t want to cause any trouble. \n\nLast time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn’t follow me around like she usually does. \n\nObviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn’t say much. She sat right between us and didn’t let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I’m still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.\n\nCindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father’s gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. \n\nIm really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen. \n\nThank you. Ps. English is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish.",

    "selftext": " So, recently I was thinking about some things my mom has done while I was younger, I’m 17F now. She would make me shower with her from 10-13 even though I was showering by myself during this time and she would wash my private parts with her hands, not a wash cloth.\n\n I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further. Also, she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish. She also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it’s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly?? I remember being very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I was around 14, I told her that I had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go. \n\n Also, (last month) I was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do. I have trauma from that era specifically because I was raped in July and she knows that, she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma. But, she made me take off my pants and kept insisting that she put it in her for me. I kept saying no and that I would do it myself but she kept pushing me. \n\nI literally was screaming no and she said that my stepdad does it for her all the time. Eventually, I started crying and having PTSD flashbacks so she eventually backed off and apologized. I don’t know what to make of any of this?\n\nMy stepdad hasn’t done anything weird but he did make a weird comment about my boobs being out when I was wearing a shirt.

Whether if it's because of politics, the pandemic, race, cops, etc. It just feels like everywhere people are just angry. If they aren't angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what's been going on. When you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is.   \n\n\nThe folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about. The people around me are uneasy with what's been going on. Jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration. If you don't want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that's a huge chunk of jobs you can't get. Even if you get a job it's been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably. The folks I know that have a place either work 90% of their week, have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can't afford to.  \n\n\nThe most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting. At least on a national level.  All you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health. When you do they are actually talking about people who have Covid or have had Covid are experiencing depression. Like you can't have mental health issues without Covid? What kind of nonsense is that? Vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with \"hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal\".   \n\n\nAnyways that's all I have to say. I do really hope it gets better, but lately the longer the pandemic drags on I feel it's just going to make people worse and worse. Both mentally and physically.",

It sounds like a small thing, but I remember how badly that set me back. \n\nNow, I’m 24 years old and struggle tremendously with making effort with friends. Sometimes I doubt if my connections with friends is even real, because I act different with all of them. I adapt, and have done for years, and it’s tiring. I’m just at a stage in my life where I want to address what’s going on with me, and try to better myself. My flat mate has just messaged me asking if I want to renew our house contract for next year (which I don’t) and as a result I’ve been suffering from crippling stomach knots all morning and have been running on and off to the toilet. \n\nI don’t know if any of this makes sense at all? Or if my point is even clear? I just want to know if anyone else experiences this. It would really help to know I’m not alone.

    "selftext": "Hello, trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so I’ve chosen to write it out. I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn’t lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that’s all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn’t anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don’t feel like my body is mine, I don’t have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don’t. I don’t have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don’t “fit in” with them. I’m disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I’ve grown up is to just make sure it doesn’t happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I’m not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can’t share “losing my virginity” stories because it wasn’t funny or cute. I can’t stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don’t trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what’s to stop others. I don’t talk to friends (don’t have any), I’ve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven’t lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don’t talk to them anymore because they don’t understand why I’ve changed so much from the happy go lucky “pretty teenage girl” to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I’ve been told over and over again to “just get over it” but here we are, 10 years later. And I’m over what happened to me, it doesn’t haunt me like it use to. But that doesn’t mean it didn’t permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don’t have to just get over it, you don’t have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I’m a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: woke up this morning and saw the post get so much love! Thank you guys for sharing this, I hope it helps those that have been told over and over that it gets better to see from someone that has been through it, it really does get better.",

I completely understand that working hard, going to school, and holding an unenjoyable retail job is all a part of being a 20 year old. \n\nBut I am completely miserable and I don’t want to waste the years that are supposed to be the best part of my life, waking up everyday and having to do things I don’t care about. \n\nHow do I make my everyday life more enjoyable. I want to live a life I enjoy living. But it’s also difficult to keep up with hobbies because after schoolwork and my job and dealing with the tiredness that comes from depression, I am too exhausted to keep up with hobbies. I just end up mindlessly watching tv. \n\nCan anyone help please?",

He has not come yet, which is fine by me. However, the one message I sent him asking “is there plans we made for this weekend that I forgot about?”, he has yet to respond to. It’s been six hours since he was last active according to Facebook messenger. \n\nMy panic attack started when I had this insane thought “was he out all night boozing around getting frisky/messing with other women?”. My heart started racing, my mind was running wild, I started to breathe heavier and heavier. I was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm. \n\nFinally, I took a deep breath and thought to myself: “If he didn’t cheat on me, I’m worked up for no reason. If he DID cheat, I will deal with him later.” There was nothing I could do at that point in time, because he either did or didn’t do anything. But getting worked up about it now literally does nothing but make me miserable. \n\nI view this (the calming myself down part) as a personal victory. I’ve never been good at handling panic attacks well when I’m by myself. So I am kind of proud of myself. \n\n",

I don't view this as any one person or group of people's fault, I just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and/or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help. \n\nI wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care, referrals, and advice. I wonder if there's a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another, but with our specific involvement in the sub.

But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. \n\nIf I had gone to the hospital I would’ve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him.

I used the chat line because I get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and I lied and told him no because I was afraid of what would happen if I did tell him that I have a plan to kill myself so I told him that I was just having thoughts of suicide and that I didn't have a plan to kill myself. Then we just talked about what was going on and what's making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what I could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that I could use. I talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that I could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back. Honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and I felt a little better after talking with them. So if you're having suicidal thoughts don't be afraid to contact your local suicide hotline it might help and if you have contacted the hotline before and have had a bad experience like I did the first time don't be afraid to try again because it kind of stopped me from doing something really bad tonight.",

    "title": "I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'",
    "selftext": " \n\nThrowaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.\n\nLet me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you’ve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. \n\nMy relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I’ve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. \n\nMy manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‘sane me’ insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.\n\nIn August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‘crazy’ people behavior. Thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.\n\nTLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",

One time she told me to get naked and bend over the bed so she could check if my “hymen was intact”. \nI feel nothing but anger tbh, i normalised that behaviour from her so much that it didn’t bother me after some time, it doesn’t bother me when someone molests me in public either. I think I achieved that level of apathy and indifference by dissociation myself from my body.

I do feel anger though at her and everything she put me through, so ig i feel smth.

I woke up some time later with someone spooning me, groping me, and kissing the back of my neck. I tried to push them off, I had no idea who it was or what was happening. When I realized it was the husband I said \"no, please stop\" several times, but he wouldn't listen and kept fighting me. eventually I just gave in. He sodomized me and after he finished made me promise to never tell his wife, Liz. (she had left us alone to go pick someone up at the airport). tbh I never had a lot of self esteem and to say I felt humiliated is an understatement. I didn't want it to happen but I let it happen anyway, i could've protested more maybe if i did it wouldn't of happened. I went home. I was bleeding a lot, one of my roommate noticed and asked me what happened, after a while of her whining I told her and she said \"well that's what you get for whoring around\". \n\nI accepted what she said, and after that I never told anyone about it, not even my therapists. it's something I try to not dwell over, but when i think about it i feel gross, and sad.\n\n*Edit: I just want to say thank you all for the supportive comments.

I bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen (not naming any brand here, everyone please don't make this a post about products). I started out by locking my phone for a few hours, then a whole day, and eventually a whole weekend.\n\nIt is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health. I am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me. And I also don't have a life. So what happen is that I need to constantly chat with my friends and family, even to the point that may annoy them, and when they show a lil bit of disinterest, even when they are really just busy, I'd literally feel hurt, it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person, but yes, and I really hate myself for that.\n\nOnce I locked my phone, my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation, sometimes I'd use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does, same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me. I don't play video games and my social circles don't use facebook anymore, so I normally can shut my computer pretty quick because I feel bored again.\n\nAnd weird enough the next thing I know is that I find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores, sorting mails and even doing some exercise. I don't think I am anywhere near being mentally healthy, but seriously I am much much better off without that damn phone.\n\nEdit: Sorry guys I can't pm the brand of the device, it's against the rule, you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do. There are many boxes that do it.\n\nEdit: The point of this post is really just to put your phone away, and you will instantly feel better once you can detach from the toxicity and focus on yourself.",

    "title": "I no longer want to die.",
    "selftext": "This time 2 months ago, I was 34 weeks pregnant, with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth. After years of suffering heavily with my mental health, I thought I was too fucked up to be able to love a child. No maternal instincts, I couldn’t even look after myself, how the fuck would I look after a baby?\n\nI thought it’d be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me. That my baby would be better with someone else, I concealed the pregnancy from my entire family, I’d completely isolated myself from everybody, convinced that I would give birth, give up my baby, and never tell a soul. \n\nThe isolation, spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health. At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn’t do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I’d hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I’d do it. \n\nThis led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I’m not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I’m self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn’t go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.\n\nThen, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.\n\nMy family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I’m lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn’t want to change my mind. I wanted to die. \n\nMy family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn’t like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he’d keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. \n\n12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nFrom the moment he was here, it’s like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I’ve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. \n\nAs you’ll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn’t aggravate him. I’m never ‘too much’ for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?\n\nAll those nights I’ve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) \n\nMy baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn’t want space from me. And I’m never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don’t get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don’t have the time anymore, my boy needs me.\n\nI never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I’m still not fully. But I’m the best I’ve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I’m no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he’s so loved that he’ll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can’t imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he’s old enough for me to be embarrassing!)\n\nIt’s like all the love that I’ve had to give finally has a place to go. I’m so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. \n\n2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.\n\nNow, I’m currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. \n\nI always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I’d suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I’d finally hit rock bottom. \n\nNow I’m on top of the world. I’ve never been happier than I have being a mother. It’s been so long since I’ve truly enjoyed being alive. \n\nThis turned into a huge essay, but I don’t like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he’s here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.\n\nI’ve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I’ve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I’m doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it’s so nice to see a happy ending. I feel like I’m finally good enough at something, and that’s being his mummy.\n\nSorry to go on, I just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better. Maybe your turnaround will be nothing like mine, and I’m not at all suggesting having a baby will cure your mental illness, but for me, this is finally me coming out of the other side. \n\nI’m finally happy. At 22 years old and a decade of diagnosed mental health problems, I don’t want to die anymore.",

I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...\nI feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt. Thank you for this opportunity to open up and be heard. You are great community 🩷",

His presence makes me feel a little less alone. I still struggle with it, but he's made it a little easier cause I have this cute little guy that's always happy to see me.

    "selftext": "Firstly, I just need this out of my head. I am not posting for attention or answers. I just need to get this all out without effecting someone else with my worries or just downright dumb thoughts.\n\nI've been messing up again. Not knowing what's going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping. I don't know if I'm really worried if I've been made to feel that way. I don't know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old.\n\nHe's six. He was just 1. My other is 4. But he was just born it feels like. I'm 41. AND MY KIDS ARE 6 AND 4. How much longer do I have where I will be mentally fit to care for them? Or will I just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it's like to feel the magic of being a child? I haven't yet but one day I will. Will I make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when I die they will miss me? Will they talk about me with pride? Or will it be all the ways I failed...I'm so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling.\n\nMy father wasn't a father. He was there. He didn't beat me or hurt me or scream at me. For that he would have had to actually care I was alive. I haven't spoke to him in years and I don't see that ever changing. My mom. My mother. The most racist, horrible, mean, scorned and damaged person I have ever met. I love her but I don't ever want to see them again.\n\nI'm white. My wife is black. We have two mixed boys. The world is so messed up. Will my boys be treated different? Will they be looked down on? Will they not get chances because of it? Or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed? Why in the hell do I worry about this? Will they get killed at school? Will I be able to save them if they are in danger?\n\nHow do I cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit? I can't even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because I was never shown how to be a man and I know the world is different and It might not be right but It feels that way. I have nothing to be proud of. What my kids and wife? How in the hell has she not left me yet? I'm the most annoying person you could meet. I started puking again. I can't handle this. I used to be skinny and fast and strong. Now my knees hurt. The other day I hurt my neck from STANDING UP? It hurt for three days. I feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore. I'm 41 and anything that mattered is gone. Now I only have jobs. I have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don't hate. I have to teach my wife how to prepare for when I die. I have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of. So when I die they are okay.\n\nSo what about while I'm alive? I get that I don't matter in the long run. My children do. But I am sick of being here. On Earth. I'm scared. I'm mentally alone. I make myself feel this way and I don't know why. I just want a life I can't have. I try to make things like they were...like all the horrid holidays when I was a child I try to make so beyond special for my kids that I've spoiled them and now nothing means anything.\n\nI just want to feel like I'm wanted again. Not needed. I wish I had a friend. But I'm terrified of people. I can't even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much. I'm starting to mentally crack at the smallest things. I don't yell or scream. I go sit in the garage and cry. So no one knows it. So when someone askes me why I'm sad and I explain it, they can't follow up with \"well what you need to do is\" \"or you shouldn't feel\". No shit. I'm not doing it for attention and I didn't say it was rational but I'm a grown ass man and I should not feel like this. I should not feel like I only matter because of \"responsibilities\". I just want someone to have a better day just because I am in their life. Why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something? To be noticed. For something besides \"can I have a snack\". Or because 99% of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn't get made. I'm stretched too thin. I'm not superman. I can't do it all. I can't always make a decision. I'm human. And right now, I'm scared. And I'm not dealing with it okay. I knew that when I started to puke after I eat. There is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if I tap with a straw I can empty my stomach in 10 seconds. So now I eat once a day. And I notice that my belly stays now. My whole life I could never gain a pound. 140 was the most I ever got. Then I was 160. And my stomach was gone. Now it was bigger. I was short of breath. My hair is gray in spots. I'm getting older. I'm already old. And one day I'll die. And idk what that is either. But I know that it doesn't matter what good I do, what will matter the most is what I wasn't able to do. The areas where I failed. Because no one is perfect. So I am going to fail. And that is the one thing I cannot afford to do.\n\nI'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for a damn thing. I just needed this out. But I will say that being a man makes this harder. Men are treated different when they talk about mental health. If I could just man up I would. And I do. Every damn day I man up. I do my job. I take care of my family and I'm damn good at it. But sometimes, it all comes in at me. Sometimes I get a chance to sit and think. And that is scary. I live my life on autopilot. When I stop to think is when it's bad.\n\nI don't know any of you but I hope you are all happy. We live in an age where it's almost comical for people say they just want to be happy. But it's not. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. Or wanted to be noticed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The best thing I did for myself was post this. I was terrified to post it and you made me not only feel welcomed, but that I matter. And I don't know any of you. You helped me cope. You gave me things to think about. You gave me hope and understanding. My wife and my children are my life and I am beyond blessed in life. I know that. And I was able to come here and I found real help. In your stories. Your comments and how you related to the post. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being there for me. Don't lose that quality about you because it's beautiful. And..needed. <3",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nAbout a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. \n\nI think this is interesting for a few reasons. \n\n1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. \n\n2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. \n\n3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. \n\n\n\nSo why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. \n\n\nSecondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. \n\nHowever, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. \n\nSo I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. \n\n\nIt's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. \n\nI have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. \n\nI have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. \n\nBoth the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. \n\n\nI hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :) \n\nThanks.",

To him it wasn't, to me it is. This argument has me in fucking tears cause I'm a mess.\n\nMy whole life I've been told my feelings are too much. I was the quiet, shy kid, and was never the one to get attention. However, when I was bullied at school and at home, and developed anxiety, I tried my best to get attention the only way I knew how, pretending to be sick. After the teachers caught on that I was faking, they eventually stopped caring, and let me walk around the school yard crying. It took me so long to realize I was crying because I was extremely anxious and was begging for help. \n\nNow, having been told my entire life that I'm just overreacting, that's also how I speak to myself. I'll have a literal panic attack, and the only thought in my head is that I'm faking.

    "selftext": "hey um.. I recently found out about this \"disorder\" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)\n\nIt is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.\n\nThey often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))\n\nThose people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.\n\nEffects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that \"disorder\" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.\n\nSome people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don´t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don´t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.\n\nI recently found out that i might have this \"disorder\". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.\n\nSince then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.\n\nHere is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)\n\nIf you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.\n\nI just want people to know that this is real and effects people.\n\nthanks for reading (:",

I have felt pain, I have felt joy, I have felt grief, and I have feared for my life but nothing matches the nameless emotion waging war on me. For those who don’t personally know me, I am making a drastic move for the betterment of myself and my family financially and this is the battle I’m facing inside. I’ve felt so absent from myself and completely empty. Watching my house go from years of being the safe place for sailors, laughter, gatherings, hot meals, and an ear, to thin bare walls and empty rooms broke me in ways I never thought possible. People I’ve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place to call home, and here I am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong, twister, and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things, wondering where the time went and if I’ll ever feel family like I have over the several years I’ve built and nurtured my circle. I don’t believe for a single moment that I wasn’t meant to experience the connections and the love that I’ve felt here, but with that comes the inevitable goodbyes. The halting end of a time that saved my life. Nothing teaches you how to introduce yourself and part ways all in the same breath quite like the Navy, but it never gets easier. No more dinners with friends gathering around the table to feel a sense of family where our respective families are absent. No more beer pong nights with 90’s hits, or spontaneous card game nights. My world has fallen silent. Laughter became tears, joy became pain, and I don’t know what to do with the things that I feel. You’d think I’d be good at this as I’ve been away from those I love and grew up with for 7 years. However, I am not. I am truly weak inside and empty. I didn’t know how else to express the grief that I feel other than to write this out, though I know not many will make it this far into the novels that I write about my internal war. Please hold your friends close while you have the time, because tomorrow you could be moving across the country with nothing but a back pack and shoes and nobody to walk beside you.

    "selftext": "I hit rock bottom a couple years ago and lost everything due to clinical burnout, mental illness, trauma, and multiple deaths in my immediate family. I had no income because everyday I was struggling to keep myself alive and couldn’t work, so my bills stacked up quick from only being able to make minimum payments; and sometimes having to delay payments so I could eat. \n\nThis year has been a huge turning point for me and I was able to get a job that I love, but it’s only part time and I had to do a slow-return to prevent burnout. I’ve been slowly paying back my bills, but I guess someone got fed up with me and the bank ended up taking all my money for this month. I found out in Lush when I tried to buy a single bathbomb for my aching muscles after long retail hours. \n\nMy card declined. I played it off and left the store in a panic trying to figure out why I didn’t have five dollars, and I saw that the bank drained my account. My face must have given me away, because the cashier ran out of the store with the bathbomb I’d failed to purchase and just put his hand on my shoulder and told me it was ok. I almost didn’t take it, I was so shocked, and asked if he was sure, and he said “it’s just a bathbomb”. \n\nI got into my car and started to sob, not knowing how I am going to eat and pay the rest of my bills this month, and I had moments where I wanted to drive somewhere and not return - but my mind kept coming back to this person who showed me such kindness and generosity, a stranger, and they in no way were required to help me. \n\nI’m still emotional over it; and I plan on thanking him when I get the bandwidth to do so. Let this be a message to show people small kindnesses when you can, because you may well be saving a life and giving hope. ",

    "selftext": "I recently asked on the teaching subreddit to share some teaching advice for a kid of our family friend who is acting uncontrollably cranky. A responder started berating me for not taking the kid to therapy. I explained to them that I live in a South Asian country so accessing and affording therapy for us is extremely difficult. I'm struggling a lot with mental health. They started blaming me for not adding a disclaimer that I'm south Asian in the main post, it's not their fault for being mean to me, the majority of the users are Americans, if I need advice then I better add this in the disclaimer.\nI understand that most Reddit users are American but I thought teacher-student connection is universal irrespective of nationality. I don't understand why can't people put aside their nationality. I have had great insightful conversations with lots of people on Reddit, but I occasionally receive judgemental opinions like this. Why can't people open up to others experiences, if not then at least try to be compassionate? It sometimes does make me feel that no matter what we do, people from developing countries will always be considered stupid and unwanted.\n\nEdit- thank you so much for such heartwarming and encouraging responses. I wish to clarify that I still have equal respect for Americans as I do for every other being regardless of their background. I always try to be level headed but sometimes intrusive thoughts get the better of me as they did in this post. Every single person who responded to this post: you guys are awesome, have a great life! I'll always be grateful for your help, again thank you 💛",

    "selftext": "I have come to fully understand something, at 25 years of age - it's not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid. You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability.\n\nIf you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either.\n\nAlso, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure.\n\nI am so sorry that this happened to you and, believe me, I understand. Parents are not all as brilliant and kind as they're supposed to be. Some of them are assholes. Just want you to know you're not alone and you can live a happy life as an adult, without them.",

We’d been together since high school and all throughout college. She was diagnosed with cancer a few months after we graduated and died approximately six months later. It was obviously very painful for everybody involved, but she and I made our peace. \n\nAfter that, I completely focused myself in my career, and I’ve seen a lot of success in it. I’m in a very good place right now professionally. To get through this, I refused to even look at any girl I found even remotely attractive for like three years.

Regrettably, I think it’s made me somewhat of a cold hearted person, but it was just like the light of my life was destroyed. \n\nAbout a year ago, I met this one girl through a mutual friend, and something about her and I just kind of clicked.

    "selftext": "My fiancé walked out on me last night out of nowhere. We’ve always had an amazing, strong relationship, or so I thought. I was putting dinner on his plate, a normal evening, until he mentioned he didn’t want much because his stomachs been upset and he can’t eat. When I asked why... that’s when my world ended. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I’ve been living with terminal cancer and he’s been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he’s been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We’re just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a “normal” life. We’re supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I’ve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn’t. He told me when I just had my scans, he should’ve felt something, but he didn’t. He’s lost his compassion for me and isn’t in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he’s done, he’s not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don’t have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can’t provide that (this isn’t anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, “even if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they’ll have a mom around?” Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn’t even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn’t have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn’t have it any other way. He told me he’s not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn’t want to resent me. We never even argued. We were the couple people looked up to and my life collapsed around me in a matter of seconds. I’m having to tell people today and they’re not even believing it. Everything was perfect and then everything was gone. I don’t know how to live without him. I don’t even know how I can make this work. I’m so hurt and angry. Why propose mere months ago after 10 years just for this to happen? How can you just leave as things were getting okay and after I had everything in my life already ripped away with cancer and was trying to figure out how to rebuild and finally have a “normal” life? I haven’t slept, I can’t eat. I’m scared of what I might do when reality sets in. I’m going to die alone. Nobody wants to be with the amputee with cancer and I’m devastated. My self esteem has never been lower. I can’t have kids. I’m going to die alone. And a part of me wishes my cancer was bad again and it would take me sooner so I don’t have to do this anymore. I’m so over these cards I’ve been dealt. I had a 20% chance of still being alive in March, and he won’t be there by my side. I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid I’ll never be okay again. ",

    "selftext": "Guys, my mental health has declined so quickly this week, and I just need to get this off of my chest. \n\nTo start with some background, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I’m in recovery for anorexia (have been for 1 1/2 years). This semester is one of my hardest ones, as I’m taking 16 credit hours in 8 weeks, and it’s made me incredibly anxious, and has made my eating disorder come back into play. I feel like I’m dying because of the weight loss and my heart pounding at all times of the day. \n\nMy cousin got into an extremely bad car accident two weeks ago, and she’s in a coma, had broken her neck and jaw, and the doctors are extremely pessimistic about her recovering. They believe that IF she wakes up, she’ll be a vegetable. This is my favourite cousin; she’s so hardworking, caring, and compassionate, and she has three kiddos all under age 5. Their dad is not in the picture, so they’ve been bouncing from relative to relative, and they’re at my house currently. I’m 24, in graduate school, and have no kids of my own, so this alone has flipped my world upside down. \n\nLast night, I got a call from my mom that my grandfather is on hospice, and will likely pass away either this weekend or early next week. I have to figure out how I’m going to get to the funeral with the kids, manage my school work (I have two exams this weekend and finals are next week), and have to find someone to cover my shifts while I travel for the funeral. \n\nI just feel defeated. All of my hard work to get my anxiety and eating under control feels like it’s completely for nothing. Everything feels out of control in my life, and it feels like a runaway train that I have to catch with my bare hands. This week especially has beat me down, and I don’t know how to get back up.",

    "selftext": "Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.\n\nFor context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).\n\nI was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. \n\nHe then on proceeded to fucking ask \"where should I touch you then\" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered \"here? can I touch you here? please let me\" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.\n\nIt was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.\n\nPlease... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit? I AM SO MAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WANT TO CUT MY WR1ST AGAIN FOR DISTRACTION I CANT WITH THIS FUCKED UP LIFE IT'S HOLY WEEK FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS😭\n\n\n\n\nEdit: guys I didn't think anyone would say that this whole thing is just made up. I really needed the advice but if it's like that then I can delete this. I'm sorry if my post offended anyone in any way. That hurts. It really... really hurts",

    "selftext": "I just came off of Facebook after reading a news article about how women apparently save their money better than men. I just want to say majority of those comments are men just shitting on women. Of course there are some Andrew Tate gifs in there, some accusations of taking everything during a divorce. It’s quite concerning to read and the media is just fuelling the hate. So many men in our society actually just hate women. How did it get like this??. It’s really lowered my faith in humanity and most importantly men. I just want to say this to all of my lovely lady/trans friends. Please, please be careful out there.",
